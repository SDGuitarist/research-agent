        <h1>Test Article Title</h1>
        <p>This is the first paragraph with enough content to pass the minimum length
        threshold. It contains useful information about the topic being researched.
        The content here is designed to be substantial enough for extraction tests.</p>
        <p>This is the second paragraph with additional details and supporting
        information for the research query. We need enough text here to ensure that
        the extraction algorithms have something meaningful to work with.</p>
        <p>A third paragraph provides even more context. Research agents need to be
        able to extract content from various HTML structures, and this sample page
        tests the basic case of a well-structured article.</p>
