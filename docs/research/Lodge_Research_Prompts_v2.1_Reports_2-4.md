# Lodge at Torrey Pines — Macro Research Prompts v2.1 (Reports 2–4)

**Date:** February 23, 2026
**Purpose:** Claim-driven research briefs — start from the email, work backwards
**Designed for:** Deep research tools (Perplexity Pro, Grok Deep Research, ChatGPT Deep Research, or similar)
**Changes from v2.0:** Email-first framework, cost intelligence, Lodge guest voice mining, objection hunting, compressed deliverable structure

---

## EMAIL-FIRST FRAMEWORK

### The One Rule

**Start from the email. Work backwards.** Every batch exists to verify or kill a specific claim Oscar will read. If a data point doesn't serve the email, it doesn't belong in the report.

### Draft Oscar Email (The Actual Deliverable)

```
Oscar —

Seven of eight San Diego luxury properties program live entertainment.
The Lodge is the only one at zero.

You've seen this work firsthand — at Pelican Hill, at the Fairmont, at
Hard Rock. Grand Del Mar already has their summer 2026 calendar posted.
Estancia — two miles away — programs 6-7 nights a week.

Meanwhile, OpenTable still ranks The Grill as the #1 "live music
restaurant" in Torrey Pines. Guests book expecting it and find silence.

Pacific Flow Entertainment is not Acoustic Spot. One dedicated artist,
30 years' experience, 9 years at your property. Self-contained setup.
Spanish guitar that fits the Craftsman aesthetic — not a rotating roster
of cover bands.

A Friday-Saturday patio set at The Grill runs roughly $[X]/month — a
rounding error on your F&B budget — and properties that program
entertainment see [Y]% higher beverage spend and [Z]% longer dwell time
on music nights.

I'd welcome 15 minutes to walk through what summer programming could
look like.

Alex Guillen
Pacific Flow Entertainment

### Claims That Need Research (Everything Else Is Appendix)

| # | Claim in Email | Status After Report 1 | What's Still Needed | Which Report/Batch |
|---|---------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | "7 of 8 SD properties program entertainment" | **VERIFIED** | Minor: verify no changes since Feb 23 | Report 4, Batch 1-2 |
| 2 | "You've seen this at Pelican Hill, Fairmont, Hard Rock" | **PARTIALLY VERIFIED** — Oscar worked there, properties had entertainment | **PRESSURE-TEST:** Andrea guitar claim rests on current OpenTable listing applied to pre-2016 tenure. Search archived reviews, Yelp from that era. If we can't confirm, flag it — don't use it. | Report 2, Batch 3 |
| 3 | "Grand Del Mar has summer 2026 calendar" | **VERIFIED** | Capture the actual calendar for leave-behind | Report 4, Batch 1 |
| 4 | "Estancia programs 6-7 nights/week, 2 miles away" | **VERIFIED** | Go deeper: what does it look and sound like? Specific performers, vibe, crowd, reviews | Report 4, Batch 1 |
| 5 | "OpenTable guest expectation gap" | **VERIFIED but not forensic** | Full stale data audit with exact URLs and quotes | Report 3, Batch 3 |
| 6 | "Costs $[X]/month" | **NOT RESEARCHED — biggest gap** | Search GigSalad, The Bash, Thumbtack for SD solo guitarist rates. Estimate a monthly line item. Answer: "what does this cost me?" | Report 2, NEW Batch |
| 7 | "[Y]% beverage spend, [Z]% dwell time" | **PARTIALLY** — BMI/NRG data exists, source quality untested | Verify source quality. Find luxury-specific data. If it's all Tier 3 blog stats, flag it and don't put it in the email. | Report 2, Batch 2 |
| 8 | "PFE is different from Acoustic Spot" | **VERIFIED** | Add: what does Acoustic Spot charge? If PFE costs the same or less for a better product, that's the kill shot. | Report 4, Batch 4 |
| 9 | "Lodge guests want entertainment back" | **NOT RESEARCHED — second biggest gap** | Mine TripAdvisor, Google, Yelp, OpenTable for Lodge/Grill/Valentien reviews mentioning music. 5-10 guest quotes > 46 property profiles. | Report 2, Batch 4 + Report 4, Batch 3 |

### What's Already Done (Don't Re-Research)

These claims are verified from Report 1. Use them as established facts, not research targets:
- 29/33 luxury properties program entertainment (industry norm)
- 5/8 SD competitors use Acoustic Spot (vendor concentration)
- Oscar's career: 7 properties, all with entertainment, Lodge is his first at zero
- Spanish guitar confirmed at 5+ SoCal luxury properties (genre validated)
- Dark-to-restart: every restart = same or upgrade (pattern established)
- No luxury brand mandates entertainment — always property-level decision
- Feb-March 2026 is the optimal outreach window

### Deliverable Structure (All Reports)

Reports should produce **this**, not 1,200-line encyclopedias:

1. **Page 1: The email** — Final draft with all claims filled in or flagged
2. **Page 2: Evidence card** — The 6-8 claims, each with its strongest source and tier label. If a claim can't survive source scrutiny, say so.
3. **Pages 3-5: One-pagers** — SD competitor summary, Evans portfolio comparison, cost model. Leave-behind material if Oscar asks for more.
4. **Everything else: Appendix** — Full research findings. Nobody reads this unless a specific claim is challenged.

### Objection Hunting (Required for Every Batch)

Every batch must include a **"Kill or Flag"** section at the end:

> For every major claim this batch supports, ask: **What's the strongest counterargument?** Then either kill it with evidence or flag it as a real risk PFE should not ignore.
>
> Examples:
> - "Fine dining music is rare (12% of properties)" → Why? Noise complaints? Acoustic problems? Guest complaints? If there's a real reason, PFE needs to know before proposing it for A.R. Valentien.
> - "Entertainment drives beverage spend" → Does it also slow table turns, reducing total covers? What's the net revenue impact?
> - "Estancia programs 6-7 nights/week" → Are they happy with it? Any reviews saying the music is too loud, wrong genre, disruptive?

---

## Key Context from Report 1 (Quick Reference — Don't Re-Research)

| Verified Claim | Source | Confidence |
|---------------|--------|-----------|
| 7/8 SD competitors program entertainment | Report 1, Tier 0 scan | HIGH |
| 5/8 use Acoustic Spot | Report 1, Batch 1 | HIGH |
| Oscar's 7 former properties all had entertainment | Report 1, Tier 4 | HIGH |
| Grand Del Mar publishing summer 2026 dates | Report 1, Batch 1 | HIGH |
| Estancia 6-7 nights/week | Report 1, Batch 1 | MEDIUM (needs depth) |
| Andrea guitar (Pelican Hill) during Oscar's tenure | Report 1, Tier 4 | **LOW — needs pressure-testing** |
| Entertainment costs "$100K-$500K+" | Report 1 (entertainment agency website) | **USELESS — range too wide** |
| Lodge guests want entertainment back | NOT RESEARCHED | **GAP** |
| Actual cost of Fri-Sat solo guitarist in SD | NOT RESEARCHED | **GAP** |

## Report 2: What Does This Cost and What Does It Get Me?

### Oscar's Only Question

Oscar Gonzalez ran a hospitality consultancy (Behind The Lines) focused on venue audits, revenue strategy, and pricing optimization. He won't ask "what does Sea Island's bagpiper do?" He'll ask: **"What does this cost me and what does it get me?"**

This report answers that question. Nothing else.

### What We Already Have (Don't Duplicate)

- BMI/NRG: 82% say live music makes experience more enjoyable, 80% stay longer, 60% buy more F&B, 5-10% check increase
- UK data: ~25% revenue jump on music nights
- Report 1: 29/33 luxury properties program entertainment, 7/8 SD competitors active
- Report 1 executive quotes already captured
- Discard: Round 1 piano blog stats (Tier 3 junk)

### Batch Execution Strategy (Restructured — Claim-Driven)

| Batch | Email Claim It Serves | What It Answers |
|-------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Batch 1** | "$[X]/month — rounding error on F&B budget" | **What does entertainment actually cost in San Diego?** Actual rates from public sources. Build a monthly cost estimate Oscar can look at and say "that's nothing." |
| **Batch 2** | "[Y]% beverage spend, [Z]% dwell time" | **What does it get him?** ROI data — but ONLY data strong enough to put in an email. Source-quality filter: if it's Tier 3, it doesn't make the email. |
| **Batch 3** | "You've seen this at Pelican Hill, Fairmont, Hard Rock" | **Pressure-test Oscar's career claims.** Verify Andrea guitar existed during his tenure. If we can't confirm it, flag it so PFE doesn't make a false claim in the email. |
| **Batch 4** | (Supports meeting, not email) | **Lodge guest voices.** Mine reviews for 5-10 quotes from guests who loved the music or noticed it's gone. This is meeting material, not email material — but it's the most persuasive evidence we're missing. |
| **Batch 5** | Synthesis | Draft the evidence card. Fill in the email variables. Flag what's weak. |

### Batch 1 Prompt: Cost Intelligence — "What Does This Cost Me?"

> **Research Request: What Does Live Entertainment Actually Cost at a San Diego Luxury Resort? (February 2026)**
>
> This is the most important batch in the entire research program. The F&B Director's first question will be "what does this cost me?" If we can show him the answer is "less than a weekend brunch special," the conversation shifts from "can we afford this?" to "why aren't we doing this already?"
>
> **CRITICAL: Find actual dollar amounts, not ranges. "$100K–$500K" is useless. "$200/night for a solo guitarist" is useful.**
>
> **Part 1: San Diego Solo Guitarist Market Rates**
>
> Search these public booking platforms for actual rates in San Diego:
>
> 1. **GigSalad** — gigsalad.com
>    - Search: "acoustic guitarist San Diego," "Spanish guitar San Diego," "solo musician San Diego"
>    - Capture: price ranges listed by performers (GigSalad shows starting rates)
>    - How many solo guitarists are listed in San Diego? What's the rate distribution?
>
> 2. **The Bash (formerly GigMasters)** — thebash.com
>    - Search: "acoustic guitarist San Diego," "solo musician San Diego"
>    - Capture: quoted rates, booking ranges
>
> 3. **Thumbtack** — thumbtack.com
>    - Search: "live musician San Diego," "guitarist for hire San Diego"
>    - Capture: quoted rates
>
> 4. **Acoustic Spot Entertainment** — acousticspottalent.com
>    - Do they publish rates? (Probably not, but check)
>    - Check their "How It Works" or FAQ page for any pricing guidance
>    - Search Google: "Acoustic Spot Entertainment pricing" or "Acoustic Spot rates San Diego"
>    - Check Yelp reviews of Acoustic Spot — do any mention pricing?
>
> 5. **Google search** — "how much does a solo guitarist cost San Diego," "live music restaurant cost per night," "hotel entertainment budget per performance"
>
> 6. **LinkedIn / industry forums** — Any hospitality professionals discussing entertainment budgets or performer fees
>
> **Part 2: Build the Monthly Cost Estimate**
>
> Using the rates found above, calculate:
>
> | Scenario | Calculation | Monthly Cost |
> |----------|------------|-------------|
> | **Fri-Sat only** (minimum) | 2 nights/week × $[rate]/night × 4.3 weeks | $[X]/month |
> | **Wed-Sat** (Alex's former schedule) | 4 nights/week × $[rate]/night × 4.3 weeks | $[X]/month |
> | **Nightly** (Estancia/RBI model) | 7 nights/week × $[rate]/night × 4.3 weeks | $[X]/month |
>
> Context: Alex's 2016 contract was $200/performance (never renegotiated over 9 years). Use this as a reference point but note it may need adjustment for 2026 market rates.
>
> **Part 3: Cost as % of F&B Revenue**
>
> Help Oscar see this as a rounding error:
> - What's the typical F&B revenue for a property like The Grill? (Search for: luxury hotel restaurant revenue benchmarks, resort restaurant revenue per seat)
> - If The Grill does $[X]M/year in F&B, what percentage is $[Y]/month in entertainment?
> - Compare to other line items Oscar already approves: linen service, floral, background music licensing (ASCAP/BMI fees), print menus, seasonal decor
>
> **Part 4: What Do Competitors Pay?**
>
> - Acoustic Spot books 5 SD luxury properties. What does a typical Acoustic Spot booking cost per night? Search reviews, forums, any public data.
> - Are there any published entertainment budgets for San Diego luxury hotels? (Unlikely, but search)
> - Industry benchmark: what percentage of F&B revenue do luxury hotels typically allocate to entertainment? Search Skift, Hotel Management, Cornell Hospitality.
>
> **Kill or Flag:**
> - If we can't find reliable cost data, say so. "We estimate $X based on GigSalad listings" is honest. "Industry data suggests $X" with no source is not.
> - If the cost estimate comes out higher than expected (>$3,000/month for Fri-Sat), flag it and recalculate the ROI to see if it still works.
>
> **Output format:**
> - Section 1: Market rates found (with source URLs)
> - Section 2: Monthly cost model (three scenarios)
> - Section 3: Cost as % of estimated F&B revenue
> - Section 4: The one-line answer for Oscar: "Fri-Sat entertainment costs approximately $[X]/month"

### Batch 2 Prompt: ROI Data — Only What Survives the Source Quality Filter

> **Research Request: Strongest Available ROI Data for Live Music in Restaurants/Hotels (2025–2026)**
>
> I need the 3-5 strongest, most citable data points on live music's revenue impact. NOT a comprehensive literature review — only data strong enough to put in a business email to a hospitality executive who thinks in ROI.
>
> **THE FILTER: Would you stake your professional reputation on this number?**
> - Tier 1 (email-safe): Named methodology, sample size stated, peer-reviewed or industry association with transparent methods
> - Tier 2 (meeting-safe): Industry survey from a credible platform (Toast, NRA, Eventbrite), named property case study, verified platform data
> - Tier 3 (don't cite): Blog post, marketing whitepaper, "studies show" with no source, round numbers that smell made up
>
> **We already have these data points (don't re-find — just verify source quality):**
>
> | Existing Stat | Claimed Source | Task |
> |--------------|---------------|------|
> | 82% say live music makes experience more enjoyable | BMI / NRG | Verify: is this a real study? What's the sample size? When was it published? Is there a methodology page? |
> | 80% stay longer with live music | BMI / NRG | Same — verify or kill |
> | 60% buy more F&B with live music | BMI / NRG | Same — verify or kill |
> | 5-10% check average increase | UK hospitality data | What's the actual source? Sample size? Year? |
> | ~25% revenue jump on music nights | UK Live Music Index | Verify the index. Is this self-reported? Which venue types? |
> | 87% would spend less at brands cutting experience | UJET 2023 | Verify methodology and sample |
>
> **IF those existing stats survive verification, we may not need more.** Oscar doesn't need 50 data points. He needs 3 he can trust.
>
> **If they DON'T survive (Tier 3 junk), search for replacements:**
>
> Priority sources (hospitality-specific, likely to have real data):
> 1. **National Restaurant Association** — restaurant.org, State of the Industry reports
> 2. **Toast** — toast.com, Restaurant Trends reports (they have actual POS data)
> 3. **SevenRooms** — sevenrooms.com (reservation platform with behavioral data)
> 4. **OpenTable** — restaurant.opentable.com/insights (they publish reservation trend data)
> 5. **Cornell Center for Hospitality Research** — Academic studies with real methodology
>
> **Priority metrics (Oscar's language):**
> - **Beverage spend uplift** — highest-margin category, most convincing to an F&B Director
> - **Dwell time increase** — directly impacts RevPASH
> - **Reservation demand on entertainment nights** — capacity utilization
>
> Skip: broad experience economy theory, generational data, "music makes people happy" studies. Oscar already knows music is nice. He needs to know it's profitable.
>
> **Also search for Danny's social media angle:**
> A Lodge server already told Oscar that live music drives guest social media posting. One or two data points supporting this would arm Oscar with backup for what his own staff told him. Search:
> - Any Toast or OpenTable data on social media posting at venues with entertainment
> - Any Instagram Business case studies for restaurants
> - Even one quantified case study (before/after adding entertainment) would be enough
> - If nothing credible exists, say so — Danny's personal observation may be the best evidence, and that's fine for an internal argument
>
> **Kill or Flag:**
> - For every stat you find: "Would I put this in a professional email?" If no, label it "meeting only" or "don't use."
> - If the best available ROI data is all Tier 3, say so clearly. PFE should then lean harder on competitive pressure (Report 4) and guest voices instead of ROI claims in the email.
>
> **Output format:**
> - Section 1: Existing stats — VERIFIED or KILLED (with source quality assessment for each)
> - Section 2: New data found (if existing stats failed) — each with source, tier, methodology
> - Section 3: Social media / UGC data (brief — just enough to support Danny's argument)
> - Section 4: **The 3-5 numbers for the email** — the final vetted list, ready to use
> - Section 5: **The "meeting only" pile** — data that's interesting but not email-safe

### Batch 3 Prompt: Pressure-Test Oscar's Career Claims

> **Research Request: Verify or Kill — Did Oscar Gonzalez Experience Live Entertainment at His Former Properties? (February 2026)**
>
> The Oscar email references his career: "You've seen this work at Pelican Hill, at the Fairmont, at Hard Rock." If this claim is wrong — if Andrea didn't have a guitarist when Oscar was there — the email loses credibility. This batch verifies or kills each career reference.
>
> **CRITICAL: We need evidence FROM THE TIME OSCAR WORKED THERE, not just current listings.**
>
> **Claim 1: Pelican Hill — Andrea restaurant had Spanish guitar**
>
> Report 1 found a current OpenTable listing mentioning "live acoustic guitarist playing Italian and Spanish influenced light classical music" at Andrea. But we don't know Oscar's exact dates there (pre-2016). The current listing may not reflect what existed 10+ years ago.
>
> Search:
> - **Yelp reviews of Andrea at Pelican Hill** — filter for older reviews (2010–2016 range). Do any mention a guitarist, live music, or entertainment?
> - **TripAdvisor reviews of Pelican Hill** — same date filter, same search terms
> - **Google reviews of Andrea** — same
> - **Wayback Machine** — web.archive.org, check archived versions of the Pelican Hill or Andrea restaurant page from 2010-2016. Did they advertise live music then?
> - **Google search** — "Andrea Pelican Hill live music," "Andrea Pelican Hill guitarist," "Pelican Hill entertainment"
>
> **Verdict needed:** Can we confirm Spanish guitar at Andrea DURING Oscar's tenure? If YES → use in email. If NO → say "we cannot verify this was active during your time" and remove from email. Do not guess.
>
> **Claim 2: Fairmont San Francisco — Tonga Room**
>
> Oscar was Executive Chef at Fairmont SF from 2016–2023. The Tonga Room (live band on floating barge since 1945) is in the same building. This is almost certainly verifiable.
>
> Search:
> - Confirm Tonga Room was open during 2016-2023 (it closed for COVID ~2020-2022, reopened 2022)
> - Oscar overlapped with both the active and the dark-to-restart period
> - Any coverage of the Tonga Room reopening that mentions the broader F&B team?
>
> **Verdict needed:** Was the Tonga Room operational during most of Oscar's 7-year tenure? (Likely yes for ~5 of 7 years.) SAFE to reference.
>
> **Claim 3: Hard Rock Hotel New York — Sessions restaurant**
>
> Oscar was Exec Chef then F&B Director, 2023-2024. Hard Rock is a music brand. Entertainment is guaranteed.
>
> Quick verify:
> - Confirm Hard Rock Hotel NYC had live music programming during 2023-2024
> - Sessions restaurant — was it music-themed as the name implies?
>
> **Verdict needed:** Safe to reference? (Almost certainly yes.) SAFE to reference.
>
> **Claim 4: Fine dining music specifically**
>
> The email implies Oscar has seen live music work IN a restaurant setting (not just a lobby or lounge). Of his former properties, which ones had music IN the dining room?
>
> - Andrea at Pelican Hill → dining room music (if verified)
> - Tonga Room → bar/lounge, not dining room
> - Hard Rock Sessions → restaurant with music theme
>
> **This matters because:** PFE is proposing music at A.R. Valentien (fine dining) and The Grill (casual fine dining). If Oscar has only seen lobby/lounge music, fine dining music may feel like a stretch to him. If he's seen it work at Andrea, it's familiar.
>
> **Also: Why is fine dining music rare (only 12% of properties)?**
>
> Report 1 found fine dining music at only 4 active properties. Instead of calling this "white space," ask WHY:
> - Search for: "live music fine dining complaints," "noise concerns restaurant music," "acoustic challenges fine dining"
> - Are there guest reviews at Eau Palm Beach (Angle), Broadmoor (Penrose Room), or Kiawah (Ocean Room) that complain about music being disruptive during dinner?
> - Are there industry articles about the challenges of programming music in fine dining settings?
> - Is the 12% rate because it doesn't work, because nobody's tried, or because it requires careful execution?
>
> **Kill or Flag:**
> - If fine dining music generates complaints at the 4 properties that do it, PFE should focus the pitch on The Grill (casual) and Judson's (pool bar), not A.R. Valentien.
> - If fine dining music gets rave reviews at those properties, it strengthens the A.R. Valentien proposal.
>
> **Output format:**
> - Section 1: Pelican Hill — VERIFIED / UNVERIFIABLE / KILLED (with evidence)
> - Section 2: Fairmont San Francisco — VERIFIED / KILLED
> - Section 3: Hard Rock NYC — VERIFIED / KILLED
> - Section 4: Fine dining music risk assessment — safe to propose for A.R. Valentien? Yes / Proceed with caution / No
> - Section 5: Updated email language — which career references survived?

---

### Batch 4 Prompt: Lodge Guest Voices — The Missing Evidence

> **Research Request: What Do Lodge Guests Say About Live Music? (2016–2026)**
>
> This is the biggest hole in all our research. We have 46 property profiles. We have zero evidence that Lodge guests want entertainment back. If even 5-10 guest reviews say "we loved the live music" or "the restaurant felt different without it," that's more persuasive to Oscar than every other data point combined.
>
> **This is meeting material, not email material.** The email makes the business case. The meeting shows him his own guests' words.
>
> **CRITICAL: This batch is ONLY about Lodge/Grill/Valentien reviews. Don't search competitor properties — that's Report 4's job.**
>
> **Part 1: Historical Reviews — When Music Was Active (2016–2025)**
>
> Search for reviews of The Grill at Torrey Pines and A.R. Valentien from the period when Alex performed (May 2016 through ~April 2025). Look for any mention of: "music," "live music," "guitar," "guitarist," "Spanish guitar," "performer," "musician," "entertainment," "ambiance," "atmosphere."
>
> Search these platforms:
> 1. **OpenTable: The Grill at Torrey Pines** — The Grill has 2,634 reviews with a 4.8/5 ambience score. Mine for any reviews from 2016-2025 mentioning live music.
> 2. **Yelp: The Grill at Torrey Pines** — Search reviews mentioning music
> 3. **Google Reviews: The Grill at Torrey Pines** — Same
> 4. **TripAdvisor: Lodge at Torrey Pines** — Reviews mentioning The Grill + music
> 5. **OpenTable: A.R. Valentien** — Any reviews mentioning Friday live music
> 6. **Yelp: A.R. Valentien** — Same
> 7. **Google Reviews: A.R. Valentien** — Same
> 8. **TripAdvisor: A.R. Valentien** — Same
> 9. **Google search** — "Lodge at Torrey Pines live music," "The Grill Torrey Pines guitar," "A.R. Valentien live music review"
>
> **What to capture from each review:**
> - Direct quote (exact words or close paraphrase)
> - Platform
> - Approximate date
> - Star rating
> - Does the reviewer name the music/guitarist specifically?
> - Does the reviewer say the music improved their experience?
> - Is the reviewer a repeat guest? (Look for language like "we always come here," "our regular spot," "we've been coming for years")
>
> **Part 2: Recent Reviews — After Music Stopped (May 2025 – February 2026)**
>
> Search the SAME platforms for The Grill and A.R. Valentien reviews from May 2025 onward. Look for:
> - Any review mentioning the absence of live music
> - Any review saying "not what it used to be," "something was missing," "the atmosphere was different"
> - Any review from a repeat guest comparing current experience to past visits
> - Any review mentioning the restaurant felt "quiet," "empty," "lacking atmosphere"
> - Any drop in ambience scores on OpenTable between the music era and the dark era
>
> **Also check:**
> - Has The Grill's OpenTable ambience score (4.8/5) changed since music stopped?
> - Has A.R. Valentien's average rating changed since the renovation reopening + no music?
> - Any review mentioning the stale "live music" claim on the website or OpenTable?
>
> **Part 3: The Grill's OpenTable "Live Music Restaurant" Ranking**
>
> OpenTable ranks The Grill #1 for "live music restaurants in Torrey Pines" despite zero live music. Search for:
> - Any guest review that specifically mentions booking because of the live music ranking
> - Any guest review expressing disappointment that there was no live music despite the listing
> - This is the single most concrete example of the guest expectation gap
>
> **What we need from this batch:**
> - **Best case:** 5-10 direct guest quotes praising the live music (historical) + 2-3 quotes noting its absence (recent). This is a before/after story Oscar can see with his own eyes.
> - **Worst case:** Zero reviews mention music at all. That's still a finding — it means entertainment was seamlessly integrated (background, not disruptive) and guests took it for granted rather than actively noticing it. Report that honestly.
>
> **Kill or Flag:**
> - If we find negative reviews about the music (too loud, wrong genre, disruptive), report them. PFE needs to know if entertainment was ever a complaint.
> - If the ambience scores haven't changed since music stopped, that weakens the "dark venue penalty" argument. Report it honestly.
>
> **Output format:**
> - Section 1: Historical guest quotes praising live music (organized by platform, with dates)
> - Section 2: Recent guest quotes noting absence (if any)
> - Section 3: OpenTable ambience score trend (if measurable)
> - Section 4: OpenTable live music ranking — guest expectation gap evidence
> - Section 5: Assessment — How strong is the guest voice evidence? Strong (5+ quotes) / Moderate (2-4) / Weak (0-1) / Negative (guests complained about music)

### Batch 5 Prompt: Report 2 Synthesis — Fill In the Email

> **Synthesis Task: Combine Batches 1-4 Into the Email and Evidence Card**
>
> This is not a research batch. This is the assembly step. Take the findings from Batches 1-4 and produce three deliverables:
>
> **Deliverable 1: The Updated Email Draft**
>
> Fill in every variable from the draft email in the Email-First Framework:
> - $[X]/month → from Batch 1 cost intelligence
> - [Y]% beverage spend → from Batch 2 ROI data (only if Tier 1 or 2)
> - [Z]% dwell time → from Batch 2 ROI data (only if Tier 1 or 2)
> - Career references → from Batch 3 verification (only verified claims)
>
> If a variable can't be filled with credible data, either:
> - Remove the claim from the email, or
> - Rewrite the sentence to be qualitative instead of quantitative ("properties that program entertainment see measurably higher beverage spend" instead of a specific percentage)
>
> **Deliverable 2: The Evidence Card (1 page)**
>
> | Claim | Data Point | Source | Tier | Email or Meeting? |
> |-------|-----------|--------|------|-------------------|
> | Competitive gap | 7/8 SD competitors program entertainment | Report 1 | T2 | Email |
> | Cost | $[X]/month for Fri-Sat | Batch 1 (GigSalad/Thumbtack) | T2/T3 | Email |
> | ROI | [Best surviving stat] | Batch 2 | T?? | Email if T1-2 / Meeting if T3 |
> | Oscar's career | [Verified references] | Batch 3 | T2 | Email |
> | Guest voices | [Best quotes] | Batch 4 | T2 | Meeting |
> | Expectation gap | OpenTable #1 live music ranking, no music | Report 1 / Report 3 | T2 | Email |
>
> **Deliverable 3: The One-Page Cost Model**
>
> A simple table Oscar can look at in 30 seconds:
>
> ```
> ENTERTAINMENT COST MODEL — THE GRILL AT TORREY PINES
>
> Scenario A: Friday-Saturday (minimum)
>   Performer fee:    $[X]/night × 8 nights/month = $[Y]/month
>   Annual cost:      $[Z]/year
>   As % of est. F&B: [X]%
>
> Scenario B: Wednesday-Saturday (Alex's former schedule)
>   Performer fee:    $[X]/night × 17 nights/month = $[Y]/month
>   Annual cost:      $[Z]/year
>   As % of est. F&B: [X]%
>

## Report 3: Evans Hotels Portfolio — Your Sister Properties Invest While the Flagship Is Dark

### Email Claim This Serves

This report verifies one sentence in the email: **"Your sister properties invest in entertainment while the flagship is dark."** If the Catamaran and Bahia both program entertainment, the Lodge is the only Evans property at zero. That's an internal inconsistency Matt Adams (COO over all three properties) can see on a spreadsheet.

### Kill Condition

If NEITHER the Catamaran nor Bahia currently programs entertainment, this argument dies. Report it honestly and lean harder on Reports 2 and 4 instead.

### What We Already Have (Don't Duplicate)

- **Catamaran Resort:** Feb 9, 2026 on-site recon — live music observed Tues/Thurs 6pm, Sun 12pm, possibly Wed, summer weekends expanded. Bartender Matt noted less live music lately. Slack key Hawaiian ambient on speakers. Moray's Lounge. Full org chart mapped.
- **Bahia Resort Hotel:** Bianchi Italian restaurant opened late May 2025 (Chef Ignazio Tagliavia, Palermo native, wood-fired pizza, Italian piazza concept). Replaced The Tangier Bar. GM Stefan Peroutka. Fernando M. as Corporate Dir F&B. Acoustic Spot listed as vendor (from Report 1 Batch 1).
- **Lodge at Torrey Pines:** Confirmed zero entertainment since ~Nov 2025. Concierge says "probably summertime." Piped-in wallpaper audio at The Grill only.
- **Report 1 vendor finding:** Acoustic Spot books Bahia Resort Hotel (and formerly booked the Lodge). If Acoustic Spot books the Bahia and the Catamaran has live music, the Lodge is the only Evans property without entertainment.

### Batch Execution Strategy

Execute in **3 focused batches:**

| Batch | Focus | Why Separate |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Batch 1** | Catamaran Resort — deep entertainment scan | Most verifiable (we have recon baseline) |
| **Batch 2** | Bahia Resort Hotel — full entertainment scan + Bianchi deep dive | Least known — needs the most discovery |
| **Batch 3** | Cross-portfolio analysis + Lodge stale data forensic audit | The synthesis — portfolio pressure argument |

## Report 4: San Diego Competitive Set — What the Property Down the Street Is Doing

### Email Claim This Serves

"Seven of eight San Diego luxury properties program live entertainment. The Lodge is the only one at zero." This claim is already verified from Report 1. Report 4 goes deeper to answer Oscar's follow-up questions: "What exactly are they doing? What does it look like? What do their guests say about it? And what does Estancia — 2 miles away with my former chef — program 6-7 nights a week?"

Oscar doesn't care about The Greenbrier's waltz orchestra. He cares about the property down the street.

### What We Already Have (Don't Duplicate)

Report 1 Tier 0 captured these high-level findings. Do NOT re-research the basic facts — go deeper.

| Property | Report 1 Finding | What Report 4 Adds |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Fairmont Grand Del Mar | Multi-format, Acoustic Spot, summer 2026 dates published | Review quotes, Supper Club performance data, local press |
| Rancho Valencia | Acoustic Spot, Fri-Sat | Review quotes, specific performers, Pony Room detail |
| Estancia La Jolla | 6-7 nights/week, Acoustic Spot, KT Weber | Review quotes about music, post-renovation detail, direct Lodge comparison |
| L'Auberge Del Mar | Weekend ambient, Acoustic Spot | Review quotes, seasonal terrace detail |
| Rancho Bernardo Inn | 7 nights/week Pony Room, Acoustic Spot | Review quotes, most aggressive programming detail |

| Pendry San Diego | DJ-forward lifestyle | Review quotes, Oxford Social Club detail |
| Park Hyatt Aviara | Nightly lobby + Jazz series | Review quotes, Jazz at the Park history, property-level decision context |

### Batch Execution Strategy

### Batch 4 Prompt: Competitive Gap Analysis + Report 4 Synthesis

> **Research Request: San Diego Luxury Hotel Entertainment — Competitive Gap Analysis and Narrative (February 2026)**
>
> This batch synthesizes Batches 1–3 into a competitive narrative for the Lodge F&B Director. Also search for any new or discontinued entertainment programs in the San Diego luxury market (2025–2026).
>
> ---
>
> **Part A: Market Changes (2025–2026)**
>
> Search for any San Diego luxury hotel that has:
> - **Launched** a new entertainment program in 2025 or 2026 (any property, not just the hit list)
> - **Expanded** an existing entertainment program
> - **Discontinued** entertainment in 2025 or 2026
> - **Changed vendors** (switched from Acoustic Spot to another provider, or vice versa)
> - **Created a branded entertainment series** (like Grand Del Mar's Supper Club)
> - **Hired for an entertainment-related role** (job postings for entertainment directors, event coordinators, etc.)
>
> Search: LinkedIn job postings for San Diego hotels + "entertainment" or "music" or "events programming." Indeed, Glassdoor for similar.
>
> ---
>
> **Part B: Vendor Landscape + Acoustic Spot Pricing**
>
> Report 1 found that 5 of 8 SD competitors use Acoustic Spot. Go deeper — especially on COST:
>
> 1. **Acoustic Spot Entertainment** — acousticspottalent.com:
>    - Full list of San Diego luxury hotel clients
>    - **PRICING (highest priority):** What does Acoustic Spot charge per performance? Per night? Monthly retainer? Search:
>      - acousticspottalent.com FAQ, pricing page, "How It Works"
>      - Yelp reviews OF Acoustic Spot (not the venues) — do any mention cost?
>      - Google search: "Acoustic Spot Entertainment pricing," "Acoustic Spot rates," "how much does Acoustic Spot charge"
>      - GigSalad / The Bash — are any Acoustic Spot performers also listed on these platforms with visible rates?
>      - Any hospitality forums or Reddit threads discussing Acoustic Spot pricing
>    - What genres do they offer? Do they offer Spanish guitar / flamenco specifically?
>    - How many total performances per week across luxury properties?
>
> 2. **What does entertainment actually cost the competitors?**
>    - If Acoustic Spot charges $[X]/night and Grand Del Mar books them 2 nights/week, Grand Del Mar spends ~$[X×8]/month on entertainment.
>    - If Estancia books 6-7 nights/week, they spend ~$[X×28]/month.
>    - Build a competitor cost estimate table if rate data is available.
>
> 3. **PFE vs. Acoustic Spot — the differentiation one-liner:**
>    - Acoustic Spot: rotating unknown artists, commodity booking, same performers at 5 competing properties
>    - PFE: dedicated residency artist, 30 years experience, 9 years at this specific property, Spanish guitar specialist, self-contained setup
>    - If PFE costs the same or less than Acoustic Spot for a better product, that's the kill shot. Calculate this if pricing data is available.
>
> ---
>
> **Part C: OpenTable and Platform Tag Verification**
>
> For each of the 8 competitor properties + the Lodge, verify the following on OpenTable:
>
> | Property | Is it tagged for "live music"? | Does it actually have live music? | Mismatch? |
> |----------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------|
> | [Each property] | Yes / No | Yes / No | Yes / No |
>
> Also check:
> - Search OpenTable for "live music restaurants near Torrey Pines" — what appears?
> - Search OpenTable for "live music restaurants La Jolla" — what appears?
> - Search OpenTable for "live music restaurants San Diego" — which competitors appear?
> - Is The Grill at Torrey Pines still ranked #1 for live music? (Per Report 1 it was)
>
> **The point:** If the Lodge is ranked as a "live music restaurant" on a major booking platform despite having zero live music, this is a concrete, documented guest expectation failure that entertainment programming would solve.
>

>
> **REPORT 4 SYNTHESIS — After completing all 4 batches:**
>
> Combine Batches 1–4 into a unified Report 4 with the following structure:
>
> **Part 1:** Property-by-property deep dive (Batches 1–2)
> **Part 2:** Guest review evidence (Batch 3, Section 1–3)

> |----------|-----------------|-------------|--------|----------------|----------------------|
> | Estancia La Jolla | 2 mi | 6-7 | Acoustic Spot | [best quote] | $[X] |
> | Fairmont Grand Del Mar | 15 mi | [X] | Acoustic Spot | [best quote] | $[X] |
> | Rancho Valencia | 20 mi | [X] | Acoustic Spot | [best quote] | $[X] |
> | [etc.] | — | — | — | — | — |
> | **Lodge at Torrey Pines** | **—** | **0** | **None** | **[absence quote if found]** | **$0** |
>
> **Page 2: The Three Things Oscar Needs to Know**
>
> 1. **The gap is total.** 7 of 8 competitors program entertainment. The Lodge is the only one at zero. This isn't a marginal difference — it's an outlier position.
> 2. **The threat is 2 miles away.** Estancia programs [X] nights/week, features your former chef (KT Weber), and gets [reviews mentioning music]. Guests who want atmosphere + good food have an alternative that close.
> 3. **The vendor market is a commodity.** 5 competitors share Acoustic Spot. PFE offers something structurally different. If Acoustic Spot charges $[X]/night for rotating unknowns, PFE at $[Y]/night for a signature residency is [better value / comparable / worth the premium].
>
> **Page 3: Kill or Flag**
>
> - Did the competitive gap hold? (7/8 still active → STRONG / any competitor went dark → adjust)
> - Did Estancia review mining produce compelling entertainment quotes? (Yes → great meeting material / No → lean on competitive frequency instead)
> - Did we get Acoustic Spot pricing? (Yes → build comparison / No → flag as meeting question for Oscar: "what were you paying Acoustic Spot?")
> - Did any competitor's guests complain about entertainment? (If so, PFE needs to address those concerns proactively)
> - Are there activation models from competitors that DON'T fit the Lodge? (e.g., DJ sets, nightclub programming — acknowledge what PFE is NOT proposing)

## Usage Notes (Updated from v2.0)

### The Process Has Changed

**Old process (Reports 1, v2.0):** Research everything → figure out what to say → write the email
**New process (Reports 2-4, v2.1):** Draft the email → identify the claims → research only what verifies or kills each claim → update the email

### Recommended Research Process

1. **Read the Email-First Framework** at the top of this document before starting any batch
2. **Run each batch as a separate research session** — do not combine batches
3. **After each batch, ask:** "Did this verify or kill an email claim?" If neither, the batch was wasted.
4. **After all batches for a report, produce the compressed deliverables** — not an encyclopedia. Pages, not chapters.
5. **After ALL reports are done, update the draft email** with the verified data points and finalize.

### Batch Count by Report

| Report | Batches | What Each Batch Answers |
|--------|---------|------------------------|
| Report 1 (completed) | 8 | Landscape scan (done) |
| Report 2 — Cost + ROI | 5 | Batch 1: What does it cost? / Batch 2: What does it get him? / Batch 3: Verify Oscar's career claims / Batch 4: Lodge guest voices / Batch 5: Assemble the email |
| Report 3 — Evans Portfolio | 3 | Batch 1: Catamaran / Batch 2: Bahia / Batch 3: Portfolio comparison + stale data |
| Report 4 — SD Competitors | 4 | Batch 1: Estancia + Grand Del Mar + Rancho Valencia / Batch 2: Remaining 5 / Batch 3: Review mining + press / Batch 4: Vendor pricing + synthesis |
| **Total remaining** | **12** | |

### Priority Order (Updated)

| Priority | Report | Email Claim It Serves |
|----------|--------|----------------------|
| **1** | Report 2, Batch 1 | "Costs $[X]/month" — Oscar's first question |
| **2** | Report 2, Batch 4 | Lodge guest voices — the biggest evidence gap |
| **3** | Report 3 | "Sister properties invest while flagship is dark" |
| **4** | Report 4, Batch 1 | "Estancia — 2 miles away — programs 6-7 nights/week" |
| **5** | Report 2, Batch 2 | "[Y]% beverage spend" — only if source quality holds |
| **6** | Report 2, Batch 3 | Verify Oscar career references before emailing |
| **7** | Everything else | Appendix material, meeting prep, leave-behinds |

## Document History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| v1.0 | February 22, 2026 | Initial four research prompts |
| v2.0 | February 23, 2026 | Full rebuild: expanded scope, activation taxonomy, source tiers, two-deliverable format |
| v2.1 (initial) | February 23, 2026 | Batch execution, Oscar framing, cross-references |
| **v2.1 (revised)** | **February 23, 2026** | **Fundamental reorientation based on Report 1 feedback. Six corrections applied: (1) Email-first framework — draft email at top, all research serves specific claims. (2) Cost intelligence added as top-priority batch — GigSalad, Thumbtack, Acoustic Spot rate research to answer "what does this cost?" (3) Lodge guest voice mining elevated to standalone batch — the biggest evidence gap from Report 1. (4) Objection hunting ("Kill or Flag") added to every batch — pressure-test weak spots instead of piling on evidence. (5) Compressed deliverable structure — page 1 email, page 2 evidence card, pages 3-5 one-pagers, everything else appendix. (6) Broad academic/industry research cut from Report 2 — only data strong enough to put in a professional email survives. Andrea guitar claim (Pelican Hill) pressure-tested. Fine dining music rarity questioned instead of celebrated as "white space."** |
