# Report 1 — Batch 6: Brand-Level Scan
## Live Music & Entertainment Programming — Corporate Initiatives (2025–2026)

**Date:** February 23, 2026
**Batch:** 6 of 8 (Tier 5 — Brand-Level Scan, Properties #40–46)
**Classification:** PFE Strategic Intelligence

---

## Prior Phase Risk

> **Batch 5 "Least confident about":** "Whether the Andrea guitar program existed during Oscar's tenure (pre-2016) or was added later. OpenTable listing is current (Feb 2026), and Batch 2 confirmed live guitar at Andrea. The description ('Italian and Spanish influenced light classical music') sounds like a longstanding tradition. The claim stands but should be framed carefully in the Oscar email — 'Andrea at Pelican Hill features...' rather than 'you experienced...' unless Oscar confirms it. Batch 6 (Brand-Level Scan) should be straightforward — corporate press releases and brand websites are usually well-documented."

**How this batch addresses it:** Batch 6 is structurally separate from the Andrea question — this batch examines whether brands mandate entertainment at the corporate level. However, the findings indirectly reinforce the Andrea claim: Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton (Oscar's two brand employers) both actively program entertainment across resort portfolios as standard practice, confirming that fine dining guitar at a Five Diamond resort was well within the brand norms Oscar experienced. The broader finding — that no brand mandates entertainment, making it a property-level F&B Director decision — actually strengthens PFE's position: Oscar has full discretion.

---

## Critical Finding: The Single Most Important Takeaway

### No Luxury Hotel Brand Mandates Entertainment as a Corporate Standard

Across all 7 brands researched, **zero** operate a corporate mandate requiring properties to program live entertainment. Entertainment is universally treated as a **property-level decision** made by the individual hotel's General Manager or F&B Director based on local market, heritage, and guest expectations.

**What this means for PFE:** Oscar Gonzalez has **full discretion** to program entertainment at the Lodge. There is no corporate barrier ("my brand doesn't allow it") and no corporate excuse ("my brand doesn't do entertainment"). Evans Hotels is an independent operator — Oscar answers to ownership, not to a brand standard. The decision to program entertainment is entirely his.

### But There IS a Brand-Level Trend: "Experiential Programming" as Luxury Differentiator

While no brand mandates entertainment, **every brand studied positions "experiences" and "cultural immersion" as core to their luxury strategy.** Entertainment is one expression of this — but it's left to properties to decide how. The brands that go furthest:

| Brand | Closest to Brand-Wide Entertainment | Level |
|-------|-------------------------------------|-------|
| **Auberge Resorts** | Formal Concert Series (3 seasons, presenting sponsors, dedicated corporate role) | **BRAND PROGRAM** |
| **Montage** | "Music at Montage" branding at 2+ properties; every property programs live music | **EMERGING BRAND TEMPLATE** |
| **Fairmont** | Center Stage x Abbey Road Studios (artist development, 2023–2026) | **BRAND PARTNERSHIP** |
| **Four Seasons** | Bellosound corporate music curation (13+ properties since 2012) | **CORPORATE VENDOR** |
| **Ritz-Carlton** | No brand program; sister brands (EDITION, Aloft, Renaissance) have formal programs | **PROPERTY DISCRETION** |
| **Rosewood** | PlaceMakers "Art & Entertainment" pillar; Front Row traveling cultural series | **PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORK** |
| **Park Hyatt** | No brand program; Hyatt Lifestyle Group handles entertainment for other brands | **PROPERTY DISCRETION** |

## Brand-by-Brand Analysis

### 40. Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts

**Entertainment Status:** DECENTRALIZED — no corporate mandate, but corporate music vendor partnership exists
**Parent:** Private (Bill Gates' Cascade Investment + Kingdom Holding, since 2007)
**CEO:** Alejandro Reynal

#### Corporate-Level Finding: Bellosound Music Curation Partnership

Four Seasons maintains a corporate-level partnership with **Bellosound**, a Toronto-based sound agency, covering at least **13 named properties** since 2012 (with roots to 2006 at Toronto International Film Festival).

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Partner | Bellosound (Toronto-based music curation agency) |
| Scope | 13+ properties: The Plaza NYC, FS Toronto, FS Montreal, FS Philadelphia, FS Houston, FS Silicon Valley, FS Los Angeles, FS Bogota, Grand-Hotel du Cap-Ferrat, FS Bora Bora, FS Punta Mita, FS Rancho Encantado, FS Nevis, FS at The Surf Club |
| Services | Customized audio strategy, DJ residencies, live musician residencies, soundtrack curation, sound system installation, ongoing music direction |
| Duration | Since 2012, expanding with new property openings |
| Structure | Bellosound acts as "Music Director" for each property — develops unique sonic identity while maintaining brand consistency |
| Executive endorsement | Dimitri Zarikos (Former Regional VP, FS Toronto): confirmed Bellosound handles "all music needs" with a "holistic approach" |
| Source | [Bellosound — Four Seasons](http://bellosound.com/our-clients/four-seasons-hotels-and-resorts/) — Tier 2 (vendor site with named FS executives) |

**Assessment:** Bellosound is the closest thing to a brand-wide entertainment initiative at Four Seasons. It provides ambient music curation and DJ/musician residencies, but it is a **vendor relationship, not a brand standard.** Properties not in the Bellosound portfolio program entertainment independently (or not at all).

#### No VP/Director of Entertainment at Corporate Level

The Four Seasons C-suite and VP roster contains **no role related to entertainment, programming, or music.** The closest is Paul Fiala, VP Food & Beverage, Americas, who oversees bar/lounge strategy where music is integrated — but his role carries no entertainment mandate.

**Source:** [Four Seasons Corporate Bios](https://press.fourseasons.com/corporate-bios/) — Tier 1

#### F&B VP Confirms Property-Level Discretion

Paul Fiala (VP F&B, Americas) in a 2019 trade interview confirmed that entertainment approaches **vary by property** rather than following uniform protocols. Each bar is designed to have "a very separate identity."

**Source:** [In the Mix Magazine — Paul J. Fiala Interview](https://inthemixbyimi.com/2019/06/cover-interview-paul-j-fiala/) — Tier 1

#### Centralized Seasonal Programming (Includes Entertainment)

Four Seasons corporate issues **brand-wide festive programming press releases** coordinating holiday experiences across 30+ properties. Many include entertainment (DJs, live saxophonists, jazz, swing music). This is coordinated marketing of localized programming — not a standardized entertainment mandate.

Examples from 2025/2026 festive season:
- **FS Atlanta:** DJ + live saxophonist at Bar Margot (NYE)
- **FS Silicon Valley:** Live jazz, swing, and DJ (NYE gala)
- **FS Fort Lauderdale:** Strolling saxophonist and live DJs
- **FS Anguilla:** DJ Ruckus (NYE)

#### Property-Level Music Initiatives (Not Corporate-Directed)

| Property | Initiative | Source |

| Naviva, A FS Resort | "Naviva Unplugged" — intimate concert series with award-winning musicians | [FS Press](https://press.fourseasons.com/news-releases/2025/experience-mexico/) — Tier 1 |

**No cross-property branded entertainment series exists.** Each property creates its own programming identity independently.

#### HBO/Max White Lotus Partnership (Entertainment Marketing, Not Programming)

FS partnered with Max (HBO) for global marketing activations around White Lotus Season 3 (filmed at FS Koh Samui). Included immersive experiences, themed cocktails, a 20-day Private Jet itinerary. **HBO did not renew for Season 4.** This was entertainment marketing, not entertainment programming.

**Source:** [PR Newswire — Max and FS Partnership](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/max-and-four-seasons-announce-global-partnership-ahead-of-the-hbo-original-the-white-lotus-season-3-debut-302287727.html) — Tier 1

#### CEO Strategy: "Luxury Ecosystem" — Entertainment Not a Pillar

CEO Alejandro Reynal's strategy focuses on hotels/resorts, Private Residences (54 properties), Private Jet Experience (10th year), and Four Seasons Yachts (inaugural 2026). **Entertainment is not mentioned as a strategic pillar** in any corporate press release or CEO interview. The strategic vocabulary centers on "experiential travel" and "luxury ecosystems" — referring to travel modes (jet, yacht) and real estate (residences), not entertainment.

#### Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Brand-wide entertainment mandate? | **No** |
| Corporate entertainment partnership? | **Yes** — Bellosound (music curation, 13+ properties since 2012) |
| VP/Director of Entertainment? | **No** |
| Cross-property branded music series? | **No** — each property creates its own |
| Entertainment in CEO strategy? | **No** — strategy focuses on yachts, jets, residences |

### 41. Rosewood Hotels & Resorts

**Entertainment Status:** DECENTRALIZED — "A Sense of Place" philosophy provides framework, not mandate
**Parent:** Rosewood Hotel Group (Hong Kong)
**CEO:** Sonia Cheng

#### No Brand-Wide Entertainment Standard

Rosewood's founding "A Sense of Place" philosophy explicitly does NOT standardize entertainment. It gives each property latitude to interpret "cultural immersion" through whatever medium fits the destination — music, art, cuisine, wellness, or conservation. Entertainment is one possible expression, not a required one.

**Source:** [Skift — Rosewood CEO Demands 'Sense of Place'](https://skift.com/2019/05/27/rosewood-hotel-ceo-demands-sense-of-place-in-each-property/) — Tier 1

#### 2025 Brand Refresh: "Discovery Awaits" — No Entertainment Mandate

Launched October 8, 2025. CEO Sonia Cheng: "Discovery Awaits... places discovery at the heart of everything we do." Emphasizes workshops, conservation, art curation, culinary experiences. **No entertainment or music programming mentioned as a corporate mandate.**

**Source:** [Rosewood — Discovery Awaits Press Release](https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/media-hub/press/2025/discovery-awaits-as-rosewood-unveils-a-new-chapter) — Tier 1; [Skift — Rosewood Brand Refresh](https://skift.com/2025/10/08/rosewood-bets-on-discovery-and-experiences-in-brand-refresh/) — Tier 1

#### Rosewood PlaceMakers (Launched 2021)

An ambassador program connecting properties to local cultural figures across six pillars, including **"Art & Entertainment."** However, named Art & Entertainment PlaceMakers are predominantly visual artists (John Cox at Baha Mar, David Luna at Las Ventanas). **No musician PlaceMakers identified.**

#### Rosewood Front Row (Launched 2024) — Traveling Cultural Event Series

The closest thing to a cross-property entertainment initiative. A traveling event series during major cultural moments:

| City | Date | Entertainment Component |
|------|------|------------------------|
| Hong Kong | March 2024 | Art Basel tie-in. Art, fashion, culinary. |
| Shanghai | November 2024 | "Behind the Journey" exhibition |
| **Tokyo** | **March 2025** | **Live jazz by Reuben James, DJ set by Antonin Courant, guests including Crystal Kay** |

Music is a component at some Front Row events (particularly Tokyo), but it is not the program's focus. Front Row is primarily an art/design/gastronomy series.

**Source:** [Rosewood — Front Row Tokyo](https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/media/press/2025/rosewood-front-row-tokyo-marks-beginning-of-brands-luxury-legacy-in-japan) — Tier 1

#### Property-Level Entertainment — Wide Variation

| Property | Entertainment | Format |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **The Carlyle, New York** | Cafe Carlyle (legendary supper club since 1955) + Bemelmans Bar (nightly resident pianists/jazz) | Nightly residencies — Woody Allen, Sutton Foster, Judy Collins; resident artists: Earl Rose, Bryan Eng, Tony DeSare, Billy Stritch |
| **Rosewood Washington, D.C.** | CUT Bar & Lounge — partnership with Blues Alley (oldest continuing jazz supper club in U.S.); live piano Fri-Sat 6-9 PM | Weekend residency |
| **Hotel Georgia, Vancouver** | Lobby live music — rotating lineup of featured musicians | Regular schedule |
| **Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek, Dallas** | Mansion Bar — live music weekends 8:30 PM-midnight | Weekend |
| **Rosewood San Miguel de Allende** | Luna Rooftop — live entertainment every Friday and select Saturdays | Weekend |
| **Rosewood Munich** | Bar Montez — live entertainment programming | Regular |
| **The Chancery Rosewood, London** (opened Sept 2025) | Eagle Bar — music programme curated by vinyl-first East London collective | Ongoing |

**The Carlyle is the entertainment crown jewel** of the Rosewood portfolio — Cafe Carlyle has been operating since 1955 — but this is a property legacy, not a brand standard.

#### Carlyle & Co. (Private Members' Club Brand)

Rosewood Hotel Group launched **Carlyle & Co.** as a private members' club at Rosewood Hong Kong. Includes a **Music Room** (1,000 vinyl records, intimate performances) and **Cafe Carlyle HK** (supper club modeled on NYC original). This is the strongest signal that Rosewood values music/entertainment — but it's a separate brand within the group, not a standard for Rosewood Hotels & Resorts properties.

**Source:** [Tatler Asia — Carlyle & Co.](https://www.tatlerasia.com/lifestyle/entertainment/carlyle-co-hong-kong-private-members-club) — Tier 1

#### No Corporate Entertainment Executive

No VP, Director, or corporate-level executive with "Entertainment," "Music," or "Programming" in their title exists in any published leadership announcement (2019-2025).

#### Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Brand-wide entertainment mandate? | **No** |
| Corporate entertainment partnership? | **No** — all vendor relationships are property-level |
| VP/Director of Entertainment? | **No** |
| Cross-property entertainment initiative? | **Partial** — Front Row (traveling event series, 3 cities so far) |
| "A Sense of Place" includes entertainment? | **Not specifically** — general directive to reflect local culture |

### 42. Montage International (Montage Hotels & Resorts + Pendry Hotels)

**Entertainment Status:** EMERGING BRAND TEMPLATE — "Music at Montage" branding exists at 2+ properties; every property programs live music
**Parent:** Montage International
**Founder/CEO:** Alan Fuerstman

#### Critical Finding: "Music at Montage" Is NOT Unique to Deer Valley

**"Music at Montage" is confirmed as branded programming at a minimum of TWO Montage properties**, with identical URL patterns suggesting an intentional brand template:

| Property | "Music at Montage" Page | Programming |
|----------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Montage Deer Valley** | `montage.com/deervalley/music-at-montage/` | Nightly live music at Vista Lounge (top Utah performers including Ryan Innes from NBC's The Voice); Apres DJ series at Veuve Clicquot-branded yurt (DJs on vinyl, Thu-Sun, monthly LA guest DJs); "Live at Montage" concert series during Sundance; "Sounds of Summer" weekend series Jun-Sep; cultural programming (Ballet West, Utah Opera) |
| **Montage Kapalua Bay** | `montage.com/kapaluabay/music-at-montage/` | Nightly live music at Cane & Canoe restaurant (6-8:30 PM); weekly rotation of 7 named Hawaiian musicians (Johnny Ringo, Logan Kalawaia, Liz Morales, Kealii Lum, Kapali Keahi, Scott Baird); Hawaiian cultural programming (hula, lei making, ukulele, Talk Story) |

**Source:** [Montage Deer Valley — Music at Montage](https://www.montage.com/deervalley/music-at-montage/) — Tier 2; [Montage Kapalua Bay — Music at Montage](https://www.montage.com/kapaluabay/music-at-montage/) — Tier 2; [Kapalua.com — Live Music at Cane and Canoe](https://www.kapalua.com/daily-events/live-music-at-cane-and-canoe/) — Tier 2

#### Every Montage Property Programs Live Music — But Branding Varies

| Property | Live Music | "Music at Montage" Branding |
|----------|-----------|----------------------------|
| Montage Deer Valley | Nightly + Apres DJs + concert series | **Yes** |
| Montage Kapalua Bay | Nightly (7 named musicians, weekly rotation) | **Yes** |
| Montage Laguna Beach | Daily, 7 days/week — Steve Siu (22-year resident pianist) + David Allen Baker (Wed-Sat) + Chris Jagich (Sun-Tue) | **No** |
| Montage Big Sky | Nightly piano at Alpenglow + Apres Backcast DJ Series (1-5 PM) | **No** |
| Montage Healdsburg | Weekends at Scout Field Bar — French jazz, country folk, bossa nova (Sunset Hour 6-9 PM) | **No** |
| Montage Palmetto Bluff | Live pianist at Hush speakeasy + live bands at events + live music Thu-Sat at Blitzen's Bar (seasonal) | **No** |
| Montage Los Cabos | Live music at Mezcal restaurant and beachfront dining | **No** |

**Assessment:** "Music at Montage" as a branded URL template exists at Deer Valley and Kapalua Bay, suggesting an **emerging brand standard being rolled out property by property.** All 7 Montage properties program live music — the question is whether the branded template will expand to all of them.

#### Steve Siu: Founder's Personal Pick, Not Brand Standard

Alan Fuerstman personally heard Steve Siu perform and hand-picked him for the grand opening of the first Montage in Laguna Beach (2003). Siu has performed 7 days/week, 365 days/year, averaging 50 hours/week of piano for 22+ years. Fuerstman: "Steve is the best pianist I've ever had the pleasure to work with in my entire career in the hospitality business." **No other Montage has replicated this exact model.** This was a founder's aesthetic choice that became an institution at the flagship property.

**Source:** [Steve Siu Piano — Montage](https://stevesiu.com/montage/) — Tier 2

#### No Corporate Entertainment Mandate or Director Role

No "Director of Programming" or "Director of Entertainment" exists at the corporate level or across multiple properties. At Deer Valley, entertainment programming is managed by the property's Director of Marketing & Communications (Malia Robinson). **Azadeh Nashat Hawkins** holds the title "Global Creative Director" at Montage International — the closest corporate-level role to creative/experiential direction.

**Source:** [Montage International — Leadership](https://www.montageinternational.com/our-company/leadership/) — Tier 1

#### Pendry (Sister Brand) Has Entertainment More Explicitly Embedded

Michael Fuerstman (Co-Founder, Creative Director) oversees guest experience programming for Pendry. Music and art are described as brand "non-negotiables" for Pendry. **Pendry West Hollywood** has its own music venue.

**Source:** [Montage International — Michael Fuerstman](https://www.montageinternational.com/leadership/michael-fuerstman/) — Tier 1

#### Brand Philosophy: Local Autonomy Within Framework

Alan Fuerstman's interviews consistently emphasize "locally curated" experiences and staff-empowered personalization rather than top-down mandates. The name "Montage" itself means "an artful compilation or collection."

**Source:** [Skift — Montage CEO on Ultra-Personalized Guest Experience](https://skift.com/2014/12/08/interview-montage-ceo-on-delivering-an-ultra-personalized-guest-experience/) — Tier 1

#### Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Brand-wide entertainment mandate? | **No** — but "Music at Montage" is an emerging brand template |
| "Music at Montage" at all properties? | **No** — confirmed at 2 of 7 (Deer Valley, Kapalua Bay) |
| Does every Montage have live music? | **Yes** — all 7 properties, varying in scope and branding |
| Corporate entertainment executive? | **No** — Global Creative Director is the closest |
| Is Steve Siu a brand program? | **No** — founder's personal pick, unreplicated |

### 43. Auberge Resorts Collection

**Parent:** Auberge Resorts Collection (owned by The Friedkin Group)
**CEO:** Christian Clerc (President and CEO)

#### THE AUBERGE CONCERT SERIES — Flagship Brand-Wide Program

**Dedicated brand page:** [auberge.com/music/](https://auberge.com/music/)

#### Dedicated Corporate Role

**Grace C.** — Strategic Lead, Brand Experience & Cultural Programming at Auberge Resorts Collection. This is a corporate-level position, not property-level — confirming entertainment programming is a deliberate brand strategy with dedicated staff.

### 44. Ritz-Carlton (Marriott International)

**Entertainment Status:** PROPERTY-LEVEL DISCRETION — no corporate mandate; sister brands (EDITION, Aloft, Renaissance) have formal entertainment programs
**Parent:** Marriott International
**Luxury Group President:** Tina Edmundson

#### No Corporate Entertainment Mandate

Based on extensive research, entertainment at Ritz-Carlton is **NOT a corporate mandate.** It is best characterized as a "brand encouragement" within a framework of property-level discretion.

**Tina Edmundson (President of Luxury, Marriott International):** "Luxury has evolved from being about the things you have to how you feel. Today travelers are seeking experiences that balance personal wellbeing with a sense of connection and discovery." Entertainment is not mentioned in the December 2025 "Era of High Life Worth" strategy announcement.

**Source:** [PR Newswire — Marriott Luxury Group 2026 Strategy](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/welcome-to-the-era-of-high-life-worth-an-evolving-global-luxury-landscape-shapes-marriott-internationals-luxury-group-strategy-for-2026-and-beyond-302631012.html) — Tier 1

#### Gold Standards Don't Mention Entertainment

The Ritz-Carlton Gold Standards (Credo, Motto, Three Steps of Service, 12 Service Values, Employee Promise) contain no reference to entertainment, music, or performance programming. They focus on personalized service, anticipating guest needs, and creating memorable experiences through human interaction.

**Source:** [Ritz-Carlton Leadership Center — Brand Foundations](https://ritzcarltonleadershipcenter.com/about-us/about-us-foundations-of-our-brand/) — Tier 2

#### Property-Level Entertainment Confirms Discretion Model

Every Ritz-Carlton entertainment program found is a property-level or owner-level decision:

| Property | Entertainment | Evidence of Property-Level Decision |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| RC New Orleans (Davenport Lounge) | Jeremy Davenport 25-year jazz residency | Described as "one unlike anything else in the Ritz-Carlton portfolio" — explicitly not a template |
| RC Maui, Kapalua | Nightly live music at Alaloa Lounge | Property-driven cultural programming |
| RC Naples Tiburon | Live Music Series (Fri-Sat) | Property-level events calendar |
| RC Laguna Niguel | Fever Candlelight Concerts ($50+) | Third-party partnership (Fever) |
| RC Sarasota | Live music at Jack Dusty (Saturdays) | Property-level |
| RC Waikiki | "My Story of O'ahu" sunset ritual | GM Mike Kass: "These enhancements reflect our continued commitment to providing a refined and authentic sense of place" — property vision |

**Source:** [The Scout Guide — Davenport 25 Years](https://thescoutguide.com/new-orleans/editorial/jeremy-davenport-ritz-carlton-new-orleans-25-years/) — Tier 1

#### The Critical Contrast: Marriott's OTHER Brands Have Formal Entertainment Programs

| Marriott Brand | Entertainment Status | Corporate Program |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **EDITION** | Core brand identity | "Director of Culture & Entertainment" mandated at each property |
| **Aloft** | Core brand identity | "Live at Aloft" — formal brand platform with emerging artists |
| **Renaissance** | Core brand identity | "RLife LIVE" — entertainment platform in lobbies (since 2010) |
| **W Hotels** | Core brand identity | Nightlife, DJs, cultural programming |
| **Ritz-Carlton** | Property discretion | No formal entertainment platform |

**This is a powerful finding for PFE.** Marriott knows how to build brand-level entertainment programs — they've done it at EDITION, Aloft, and Renaissance. The fact that Ritz-Carlton does NOT have one means entertainment at Ritz-Carlton resorts is purely a property-level F&B decision. Oscar's experience at Ritz-Carlton would have been defined by whichever property he worked at, not by a brand mandate.

#### Marriott Bonvoy x AEG Partnership (Loyalty, Not Programming)

Marriott Bonvoy renewed a multiyear global partnership with AEG Presents (November 2025) spanning music, sports, and live entertainment. Launched "1-Point Drops" for Bonvoy members (exclusive access to Coachella, Stagecoach, etc.). **This is a loyalty program initiative across all 30+ Marriott brands, not a Ritz-Carlton property programming standard.**

### 45. Fairmont Hotels & Resorts (Accor)

**Entertainment Status:** ONE BRAND PARTNERSHIP + property-level discretion
**Parent:** Accor (Fairmont brand)
**CEO:** Omer Acar

#### Center Stage x Abbey Road Studios (Brand-Level Music Initiative)

Fairmont's **only documented brand-wide music initiative.**

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Launched | February 8, 2023, at The Savoy, London |
| Duration | Three-year commitment (2023–2026) |
| Offering | 1,000 hours of Abbey Road Studios recording time + 1,000 hours of Fairmont suite time for emerging artists worldwide |
| Components | Documentary series, mentorship pairing, Amplify festival access, Gixon music booking integration |
| Participating properties | 19 locations: The Plaza NYC, The Savoy London, Fairmont San Francisco, Fairmont Peace Hotel Shanghai, plus Canada (4), UAE (2), Singapore, Switzerland, Monaco, Scotland, South Korea, Brazil |

**Key quote — Mansi Vagt, Global VP Fairmont Brand:** "Music is highly emotive and can be a powerful way that travelers connect to their favorite memories."

**Assessment:** Center Stage is an artist development/marketing program, not an entertainment delivery standard for guests. It does not mandate guest-facing entertainment at properties. The three-year term technically ends in early 2026 — **no public updates on continuation since launch.**

#### "Make Special Happen" Campaign — "In the Spotlight" Pillar (2025)

Fairmont's first global brand campaign since 2021 (launched May 19, 2025). Includes four experience pillars:

1. **Special Happens... After Dark** (nocturnal/wellness)
2. **Special Happens... In the Wild** (nature)
3. **Special Happens... Around the Table** (culinary)
4. **Special Happens... In the Spotlight** — "A vibrant tapestry of moments inspired by the arts, culture, music and performance"

"In the Spotlight" offerings are curated per-property: visit to Claude Nobs' home (Montreux Jazz Festival founder) via Fairmont Le Montreux Palace; artisan crafts (Fairmont Jaipur); medina tours (Fairmont Marrakech). **Not a standardized entertainment program.**

**Key quote — CEO Omer Acar:** "Make Special Happen isn't just a campaign, it's part of our brand DNA."

#### Property-Level Entertainment Varies Dramatically

| Property | Entertainment | Schedule |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Fairmont San Francisco (Tonga Room) | Live band on floating barge (since 1945); The Island Groove | Nightly from 7 PM; $20 cover |
| Fairmont Austin | Nightly live music under Fulton's oak tree | Nightly |
| Fairmont El San Juan, Puerto Rico | Daily music/entertainment in pools and lobby | Daily |
| Fairmont Grand Del Mar, San Diego | Live entertainment in Lobby Lounge | Fri-Sat 8 PM-midnight |
| Fairmont Miramar, Santa Monica | Piano by Jason Pelsey (Fri) and Sam Smylie (Sat) | Weekends |
| Fairmont Century Plaza, LA | Rotating DJs at The Bar | Tue/Wed/Thu 6-10 PM |
| Fairmont Dubai (The Theater) | Vocalists, musicians, dancers, aerialists | Regular |

No standardized entertainment playbook. Properties with entertainment heritage maintain it. Others have varying levels or none at all.

#### Accor Corporate Channels Entertainment Through Lifestyle Brands — Not Fairmont

Accor's entertainment strategy lives in the **Ennismore/lifestyle brands** (Rixos, Mondrian, Faena, SO/), not in the luxury tier (Fairmont, Raffles, Orient Express, Sofitel).

**Critical development:** Accor **sold its Paris Society nightlife division in July 2025** for ~80M euros. Accor is **pulling back from direct nightlife operations** to focus on hotels and gastronomy.

#### Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Brand-wide entertainment mandate? | **No** |
| Brand-level music initiative? | **Yes** — Center Stage x Abbey Road Studios (artist development, 19 properties, 2023-2026) |
| "Make Special Happen" = entertainment standard? | **No** — "In the Spotlight" pillar is per-property experiential, not standardized |
| VP/Director of Entertainment? | **No** |
| Accor corporate entertainment for Fairmont? | **No** — entertainment strategy goes through Ennismore/lifestyle brands |

### 46. Park Hyatt (Hyatt Hotels Corporation)

**Entertainment Status:** PROPERTY-LEVEL DISCRETION — art curation is the cultural pillar, not entertainment
**Parent:** Hyatt Hotels Corporation
**CEO:** Mark Hoplamazian
**Brand Leader:** Katie Johnson (VP and Global Brand Leader)

#### No Brand-Wide Entertainment Standard

Park Hyatt's four official brand pillars are: (1) Design & Architecture, (2) Art Curation, (3) Chef-Led Culinary, (4) Intuitive Service. **Entertainment is not a brand pillar.**

Brand tagline: "Luxury is Personal." The September 2025 campaign (first in 5+ years, celebrating 45th anniversary) uses Clair de Lune by Debussy as atmospheric score, but entertainment programming is not featured.

#### Hyatt's Organizational Split: Entertainment Is a Lifestyle Function

**This is the most structurally important finding.** In January 2025, Hyatt created a dedicated **Lifestyle Group** led by Amar Lalvani (former Standard International chairman), headquartered in NYC (separate from Hyatt's Chicago HQ). This group explicitly manages:

> **"Experience creation, design, marketing, programming, public relations, restaurants, nightlife and entertainment"**

The Lifestyle Group covers: Andaz, Thompson Hotels, The Standard, Dream Hotels, JdV by Hyatt, Bunkhouse Hotels.

**Park Hyatt is NOT in the Lifestyle Group.** Park Hyatt is in the Luxury Portfolio, which does NOT have an equivalent entertainment function. There is no "Head of Entertainment" for Park Hyatt.

#### Masters of Food & Wine — The Brand-Wide Experiential Template

Park Hyatt's **only brand-wide experiential program** — founded 2003, runs across multiple properties worldwide (Niseko Hanazono, Washington D.C., Saigon, Jakarta, Aviara). Format: chef residencies, tasting series, vineyard pairings, workshops. **Entirely culinary-focused — no music equivalent exists.**

**Source:** [Park Hyatt — Masters of Food & Wine](https://www.hyatt.com/park-hyatt/en-US/our-story/masters-of-food-wine) — Tier 1

#### Property-Level Entertainment — Strong Pattern Despite No Mandate

Many Park Hyatt properties independently program live entertainment:

| Property | Entertainment | Schedule |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Park Hyatt Tokyo** (New York Bar) | **Nightly live jazz** — most famous hotel bar music in the world (Lost in Translation) | Mon-Wed 8 PM-11:45 PM; Thu-Sat 8 PM-12:30 AM; Sun 7 PM-10:45 PM; 2,200 JPY cover |
| **Park Hyatt Aviara** (Carlsbad, CA) | Live acoustic guitar in lobby lounge nightly + Pacific Point Terrace select evenings + "Jazz at the Park" annual series | Nightly (lobby); seasonal (terrace) |
| **Park Hyatt Saigon** | Classical and contemporary piano by resident pianist | Nightly 7-11 PM |
| **Park Hyatt Kyoto** | Koto performances + jazz guitar/violin at The Living Room | Regular |
| **Park Hyatt Seoul** | Live R&B/jazz duo at Timber House bar | Regular |
| **Park Hyatt Jakarta** | Live jazz | Fri-Sat from 7 PM |
| **Park Hyatt Guangzhou** | Resident band at The Roof Bar | Regular |

#### Park Hyatt Aviara (On Tier 0 Hit List) — Already Programs Entertainment

Relevant for PFE: **Park Hyatt Aviara in Carlsbad programs live acoustic guitar nightly in the lobby lounge, seasonal live music on Pacific Point Terrace, and an annual Jazz at the Park concert series.** This is a direct San Diego competitor to the Lodge that actively programs entertainment.

#### CEO Commentary — Praises Entertainment at Lifestyle Brands

Mark Hoplamazian on The Standard's Manhattan flagship (Fortune, 2025): "The team is brilliant. It's everything from lighting to music to the flow of people to how you program the space." **He values music and programming as competitive differentiators — but expressed this about Lifestyle brands, not Park Hyatt.**

#### Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Brand-wide entertainment mandate? | **No** |
| Entertainment a brand pillar? | **No** — Art Curation is the cultural pillar |
| Corporate entertainment function? | **No** — Lifestyle Group handles entertainment; Park Hyatt is in Luxury Portfolio |
| Brand-wide experiential program? | **Yes** — Masters of Food & Wine (culinary only) |
| Properties that program music independently? | **Many** — Tokyo (nightly jazz), Aviara (nightly guitar), Saigon (nightly piano), Kyoto, Seoul, Jakarta, Guangzhou |

## DELIVERABLE B — PFE Executive Summary (Batch 6)

### Is There a Brand-Level Trend PFE Can Reference?

**The answer is nuanced — and it's powerful either way PFE frames it.**

#### What PFE CAN Say:

1. **"No luxury hotel brand mandates entertainment — it's always a property-level decision."** This is the single most important finding. Across all 7 brands studied, entertainment programming is universally left to individual property GMs and F&B Directors. There is no corporate barrier and no corporate excuse. Oscar Gonzalez has **full discretion** to program entertainment at the Lodge. As an independent Evans Hotels property, there isn't even a brand standard to consult — it's purely his and ownership's call.

2. **"The one brand that HAS formalized entertainment — Auberge — treats it as a revenue-generating, sponsor-attracting strategic asset."** Auberge's Concert Series has presenting sponsors (Mercedes-Benz, Bilt), premium ticket pricing ($175-$500), curated weekend packages ($1,400-$1,999+/night), a dedicated corporate role (Strategic Lead, Brand Experience & Cultural Programming), and a charitable component at every event. This is the model for entertainment as business strategy, not cost center.

3. **"Montage is building 'Music at Montage' as an emerging brand standard — and every Montage property already programs live music."** The identical URL pattern at Deer Valley and Kapalua Bay suggests intentional brand rollout. If Montage — a direct peer to Lodge at Torrey Pines in the luxury resort space — is standardizing music programming, the trend is moving TOWARD entertainment, not away from it.

4. **"The brands Oscar knows best (Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons) both actively program entertainment across their resort portfolios — even without a mandate."** Ritz-Carlton has Jeremy Davenport's 25-year residency. Four Seasons has the Bellosound partnership covering 13+ properties. Both program music as standard practice at the property level. Oscar's frame of reference is "entertainment is normal."

5. **"Parent companies that operate both luxury AND lifestyle brands (Marriott, Hyatt, Accor) have formalized entertainment for their lifestyle brands but NOT for their luxury brands."** EDITION has a mandated "Director of Culture & Entertainment." Aloft has "Live at Aloft." Renaissance has "RLife LIVE." Park Hyatt, Ritz-Carlton, and Fairmont have nothing equivalent. **This means luxury entertainment is an untapped differentiator** — the brands haven't standardized it, leaving a white space that individual properties (and their entertainment partners) can own.

#### The PFE Positioning Statement:

> "No luxury hotel brand in America mandates entertainment programming — it's always a property-level decision made by the F&B Director and GM. The brands that Oscar Gonzalez has worked for (Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons) program entertainment across their portfolios as standard practice, but they leave it to individual properties. The one collection that HAS formalized entertainment as a brand strategy — Auberge Resorts — treats it as a revenue-generating asset with presenting sponsors and premium pricing. Montage is building 'Music at Montage' as an emerging brand template. The trend is toward entertainment, not away from it. As an independent property, the Lodge at Torrey Pines has no brand barrier to programming — only a decision by its F&B Director."

### Top Data Points for the Oscar Email (Batch 6 Additions)

1. **Auberge Resorts — the only luxury collection with a formalized Concert Series** — has a dedicated "Strategic Lead, Brand Experience & Cultural Programming" at the corporate level and attracts presenting sponsors (Mercedes-Benz, Bilt). Entertainment is treated as a revenue-generating strategic asset, not a cost center.

2. **"Music at Montage" is expanding** from Deer Valley to Kapalua Bay as branded programming with identical URL templates — and every Montage property already programs live music independently. Montage is standardizing what the industry otherwise leaves to property discretion.

3. **Marriott operates formal entertainment programs at EDITION ("Director of Culture & Entertainment"), Aloft ("Live at Aloft"), and Renaissance ("RLife LIVE") — but NOT at Ritz-Carlton.** This means Marriott knows entertainment works as a brand strategy but has left a white space at the luxury tier. Individual Ritz-Carlton properties fill it themselves (Jeremy Davenport's 25-year residency, nightly music at Kapalua, Fever Concerts at Laguna Niguel).

4. **Four Seasons has maintained a corporate music curation partnership with Bellosound since 2012**, covering 13+ properties with customized audio strategy, DJ residencies, and live musician residencies. Even without a brand mandate, FS invests in professional music curation at the corporate level.

5. **Hyatt created a dedicated Lifestyle Group in January 2025** with explicit responsibility for "nightlife and entertainment" — but put Park Hyatt in the Luxury Portfolio, which has no equivalent function. Park Hyatt Aviara (a Lodge competitor in Carlsbad) programs live acoustic guitar nightly despite having no corporate entertainment support. If Aviara can do it without a brand mandate, the Lodge can too.

6. **Fairmont's Center Stage x Abbey Road Studios partnership** (2023-2026, 19 properties) demonstrates that even Accor — which channels entertainment through its lifestyle brands — recognized Fairmont needed a music initiative. The program provides 1,000 hours of recording studio time to emerging artists. Mansi Vagt (Global VP Fairmont Brand): "Music is highly emotive and can be a powerful way that travelers connect to their favorite memories."

---

## Three Questions (Batch 6)

1. **Hardest implementation decision in this session?** How to classify Montage — is "Music at Montage" a brand standard or not? The evidence shows it's at 2 of 7 properties with identical URL patterns, which could mean "emerging rollout" or "two properties independently adopted the same name." Decided to classify it as "emerging brand template" rather than "brand standard" because 5 of 7 properties lack the branding. However, the critical finding is that ALL 7 Montage properties program live music regardless of branding — the template is catching up to practice, not the other way around. This is the most honest framing.

2. **What did you consider changing but left alone, and why?** Considered downplaying Auberge's Concert Series because it's event-based (a few concerts per year), not nightly programming — structurally different from what PFE proposes for the Lodge. Left it as the headline finding because: (a) it's the ONLY luxury collection with a formalized, cross-property, sponsor-backed entertainment program, making it the strongest proof that entertainment can be a brand-level strategic asset; (b) the sub-programs (Bluebird Cafe at Bishop's Lodge in its 4th year, Estate Music Series at Commodore Perry in its 3rd year) DO represent recurring, programmatic entertainment closer to PFE's model; and (c) the dedicated corporate role (Strategic Lead, Brand Experience & Cultural Programming) proves the organizational commitment. The Concert Series is the tip of a broader entertainment strategy.

3. **Least confident about going into the next batch?** Whether Fairmont's Center Stage x Abbey Road Studios partnership is still active. It was a three-year commitment launching February 2023 — the term technically ends in early 2026 and there have been no public updates since launch. If it quietly ended, the finding weakens. Also, the Bellosound partnership with Four Seasons is sourced from the vendor's website (Tier 2), not from Four Seasons directly — if Bellosound overstates the scope, the "13+ properties" claim could be inflated. Both findings should be framed as "documented" rather than "confirmed active as of February 2026." Batch 7 (Executive Voices) should look for any commentary on these partnerships.
