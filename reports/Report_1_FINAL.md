| **Purpose Code** | AMB, CUL, LOY |
| **Integration** | **Most extensive daily programming in the study.** In-house troupe performing multiple times daily across multiple venues. Entertainment is woven into the property's DNA. |
| **Source Tier** | Tier 2 (property website), Tier 1 (press/historical coverage) |
| **Recency** | Continuous tradition, confirmed active 2025-2026 |
| **Notes** | Main Dining Room piano + violin is fine dining music. Casino Club waltz Tue-Sat is a "signature experience" guests come specifically for. The Greenbrier shows what entertainment looks like when it's treated as heritage, not expense. |

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Property** | Pelican Hill Resort |
| **Rating** | Forbes Five-Star |
| **Entertainment Context** | Andrea restaurant featured "live acoustic guitarist playing Italian and Spanish influenced light classical music." Lobby pianist daily. |
| **Notes** | **This is the most critical data point for PFE.** Oscar personally experienced a fine dining restaurant with Spanish-influenced acoustic guitar — the exact format PFE proposes for A.R. Valentien. He knows what this looks and sounds like in a Five Star setting. |

### Tier 5 — Brand-Level Scan (7 Brands)

**Critical finding: No luxury hotel brand mandates entertainment as a corporate standard.** Entertainment is universally a property-level decision made by GMs and F&B Directors.

---

#### 40. Four Seasons

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Brand-wide entertainment mandate? | **No** |
| Strongest initiative | Bellosound music curation vendor (13+ properties since 2012) |
| Entertainment decision-maker | Property GM / F&B Director |
| Key finding | VP F&B confirms property-level discretion |

---

#### 41. Rosewood

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Brand-wide entertainment mandate? | **No** |
| Strongest initiative | Front Row traveling cultural series (3 cities); PlaceMakers "Art & Entertainment" pillar |
| Entertainment decision-maker | Property GM |
| Key finding | "A Sense of Place" philosophy, not entertainment playbook |

---

#### 42. Montage

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Brand-wide entertainment mandate? | **Emerging template** |
| Strongest initiative | "Music at Montage" branded at 2 of 7 properties (Deer Valley, Kapalua Bay); all 7 program live music |
| Entertainment decision-maker | Property GM / Founder's aesthetic |
| Key finding | Steve Siu's 22-year residency is founder's personal pick, not brand standard. "Music at Montage" URL template suggests intentional rollout. |

---

#### 43. Auberge Resorts Collection

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Brand-wide entertainment mandate? | **YES — Brand Program** |
| Strongest initiative | **Auberge Concert Series** (3 seasons, Mercedes-Benz/Bilt sponsors, $175-$500 tickets, $1,400-$1,999+/night packages). Bluebird Cafe at Bishop's Lodge (4th year). Estate Music Series at Commodore Perry (3rd year). |
| Entertainment decision-maker | **Corporate: Strategic Lead, Brand Experience & Cultural Programming** |
| Key finding | **Most formalized brand-level entertainment in luxury hospitality.** Only luxury collection with a centralized, sponsor-backed, cross-property entertainment program with a dedicated corporate role. |

---

#### 44. Ritz-Carlton

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Brand-wide entertainment mandate? | **No** |
| Strongest initiative | None for RC specifically; sister brands EDITION, Aloft, Renaissance have formal programs |
| Entertainment decision-maker | Property GM / Owner |
| Key finding | Marriott knows how to build brand entertainment programs (EDITION's "Director of Culture & Entertainment") — chose not to for Ritz-Carlton. Entertainment at RC is purely property-level F&B discretion. |

---

#### 45. Fairmont

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Brand-wide entertainment mandate? | **No** |
| Strongest initiative | Center Stage x Abbey Road Studios (artist development, 19 properties, 2023-2026); Mansi Vagt (Global VP): "Music is highly emotive and can be a powerful way that travelers connect to their favorite memories." |
| Entertainment decision-maker | Property GM |
| Key finding | Accor channels entertainment through Ennismore/lifestyle brands, not Fairmont. Accor sold Paris Society nightlife division in 2025. |

---

#### 46. Park Hyatt

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Brand-wide entertainment mandate? | **No** |
| Strongest initiative | None; Masters of Food & Wine is culinary-only. Park Hyatt Tokyo's New York Bar nightly jazz is the most famous hotel bar music globally (Lost in Translation). |
| Entertainment decision-maker | Property GM / F&B Director |
| Key finding | Hyatt created a dedicated Lifestyle Group (Jan 2025) with explicit "nightlife and entertainment" responsibility — but put Park Hyatt in the Luxury Portfolio, which has no equivalent function. Park Hyatt Aviara (SD competitor) programs nightly guitar despite no mandate. |

---

## Part 2: Activation Patterns

### Programming Frequency

| Frequency | Properties | % of Active Properties |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Nightly (7 days/week)** | Montage Laguna Beach, The Breakers, Estancia La Jolla, Rancho Bernardo Inn, San Ysidro Ranch, Park Hyatt Aviara, Greenbrier, Broadmoor (Golden Bee) | ~28% |
| **4-6 nights/week** | Eau Palm Beach (Angle Tue-Sun), Broadmoor (Penrose Wed-Sat), Grand Del Mar (Fri-Sat + events), Ojai Valley Inn | ~14% |
| **Weekends only (Fri-Sat)** | Rancho Valencia, L'Auberge Del Mar, Kiawah, Monarch Beach, Stein Eriksen, Houstonian, Arizona Biltmore, Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel | ~28% |
| **Seasonal/Event-based** | Blackberry Farm, Montage Deer Valley (concerts), Hotel del Coronado, Terranea | ~14% |
| **Daily (non-music traditions)** | Sea Island (bagpiper), Nemacolin (bagpiper), Greenbrier (Springhouse Entertainers 2x daily) | ~10% |

### Venue Distribution

| Venue Type | Properties with This Venue Active | Most Common Format |
|------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Lounge/Bar (LNG)** | 25+ properties | Most common — low-risk, high-atmosphere |
| **Restaurant (REST)** | 15+ properties | Background acoustic during dinner |
| **Patio/Outdoor (PAT/OUT)** | 12+ properties | Seasonal expansion of indoor programs |
| **Lobby (LOB)** | 8+ properties | Arrival experience, daily ambient |
| **Pool (POOL)** | 6+ properties | Seasonal, weekend-heavy |
| **Ticketed Event (EVT)** | 10+ properties | Revenue-generating concerts and themed events |

### Fine Dining Music (Rare — Only 4 Active + 1 Closed)

| Property | Restaurant | Format | Schedule |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Eau Palm Beach** | Angle | Piano (George Bugatti, Chad Michaels) | Tue-Sun |
| **The Broadmoor** | Penrose Room | Piano trio | Wed-Sat |
| **The Greenbrier** | Main Dining Room | Piano + violin | Select evenings |
| **Kiawah Island** | Ocean Room | Piano | Fri-Sat |
| **FS Biltmore** (closed) | Ty Lounge area | Spanish guitar (Chris Fossek) | Was regular pre-2020 |

Fine dining music exists at only ~12% of surveyed properties. This is a white space — not because it doesn't work, but because most properties haven't tried it. The properties that DO program it maintain it long-term (Broadmoor: 100+ years; Eau Palm Beach: ongoing named performers).

### Residency vs. Rotating Artists

| Model | Examples | Advantages |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Named Residency** | Steve Siu (Montage, 22 yrs), DJ UKi (Breakers, 10+ yrs), Jeremy Davenport (RC NOLA, 25 yrs), Ken Miller/Director of Music (Broadmoor, 100+ yrs) | Brand identity, guest loyalty, consistency |
| **Rotating Artists** | Most properties via Acoustic Spot or similar agencies | Variety, lower commitment, easier to scale |
| **Hybrid** | Eau Palm Beach (named pianists + rotating), Ojai Valley Inn (named guitarist + rotating) | Best of both — signature performer + variety |

### Branded Entertainment Series

| Property/Brand | Series Name | Format | Duration |
|---------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Auberge Resorts** | Auberge Concert Series | Cross-property headliner concerts | 3 seasons (2024-2026) |
| **Montage** | "Music at Montage" | Branded URL template at 2+ properties | Emerging |
| **Grand Del Mar** | Supper Club Under the Stars | Monthly ticketed dinner + entertainment ($165/pp) | Multi-year |
| **Broadmoor** | Earl Klugh Weekend of Jazz | Annual jazz festival ($895-$2,715/pp) | 22+ years |
| **Blackberry Farm** | Concert Weekends | Headliner packages ($650-$1,700/pp) | Multi-year |
| **Auberge/Bishop's Lodge** | Bluebird Cafe "In The Round" | Nashville songwriting format | 4th year |
| **Fairmont** | Center Stage x Abbey Road | Artist development (19 properties) | 3 years (2023-2026) |

### Spanish/Flamenco Guitar — Established Luxury Genre

Confirmed at 5+ luxury properties in this study: Ojai Valley Inn (Aaron Copenhaguen), FS Biltmore pre-closure (Chris Fossek), San Ysidro Ranch (Stonehouse), Pelican Hill (Andrea — Oscar's former property), Eau Palm Beach (Arturo Romay at Breeze), Four Seasons Scottsdale (Talavera). Spanish guitar is an established, validated genre at luxury properties — not experimental.

### Trade Publication Gap — Strategic White Space

**ZERO trade publication articles found** covering live entertainment strategy at luxury hotels as a primary topic. Skift, Hotel Management, Hospitality Design, Lodging Magazine, and Hotel Business have extensive F&B coverage but virtually no coverage of entertainment programming as a strategic discipline. This is a strategic white space — entertainment at luxury hotels is happening but not being discussed as an industry trend.

## Part 4: Properties with No Programming

### Active Properties at Zero

| Property | Rating | Reason | Comparable? |
|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| **The Lodge at Torrey Pines** | AAA Five Diamond | Dark since ~Nov 2025; new F&B Director (Oscar Gonzalez, Aug 2025) | THE SUBJECT PROPERTY |
| **Post Ranch Inn** | Forbes Five-Star | Nature retreat — silence IS the product (no TVs, no clocks) | No — fundamentally different concept |
| **Blackberry Mountain** | Forbes Five-Star | Nature/wellness retreat — deliberate strategic zero by same ownership that programs at Blackberry Farm | No — deliberate wellness positioning |

### The Lodge's Unique Position

The Lodge at Torrey Pines is the **only traditional luxury resort** in this 46-property study with zero entertainment programming. Post Ranch Inn and Blackberry Mountain are nature retreats where silence is a deliberate product choice — they are not comparable to a resort with restaurants, bars, a pool, a fire pit patio, and 170 guest rooms.

Among the 33 individual properties surveyed (Tiers 0-3): **29 program entertainment, 2 are nature retreats at zero, 1 is closed (FS Biltmore), and the Lodge is the only operating traditional luxury resort at zero.**

Among San Diego competitors specifically: **7 of 8 program entertainment. The Lodge is the only one at zero.** The nearest competitor (Estancia La Jolla, 2 miles away) programs 6-7 nights per week.

### Recently Discontinued

No properties in this study were found to have *recently discontinued* entertainment as a deliberate strategy. Properties that went dark did so due to external factors (COVID closures, renovations, leadership transitions) — and all eventually restarted or are expected to restart. There is no industry trend toward eliminating entertainment.

---

## Part 5: Dark-to-Restart Patterns

Six documented cases of properties going dark and restarting entertainment. **Pattern: every restart resulted in entertainment at the same level or an UPGRADE — none eliminated entertainment.**

### Case 1: Tonga Room, Fairmont San Francisco

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Dark period | ~16 months (COVID closure, 2020-2022) |
| Trigger for dark | COVID-19 pandemic |
| Trigger for restart | Reopening, guest demand, heritage property identity |
| Outcome | **Same format restored** — live band on floating barge, nightly from 7 PM |
| Relevance | Oscar was Executive Chef at Fairmont SF during this period — he experienced the dark-to-restart cycle firsthand. |

### Case 2: Arizona Biltmore (Waldorf Astoria)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Dark period | ~8 years (2013-2021, major renovation) |
| Trigger for dark | Full property renovation |
| Trigger for restart | Grand reopening as Waldorf Astoria |
| Outcome | **Entertainment UPGRADE** — reopened with more entertainment than pre-closure. Multiple new venues with live programming. |
| Relevance | Longest dark period in study. Proves that even 8 years of darkness doesn't mean entertainment dies — it comes back stronger. |

### Case 3: San Ysidro Ranch

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Dark period | Unknown duration — went from zero entertainment to programming |
| Trigger for dark | No previous entertainment tradition |
| Trigger for restart | Decision to add nightly jazz and Spanish guitar in 2024 |
| Outcome | **New program created** — nightly entertainment across 2 venues, 7 days/week |
| Relevance | **Most directly parallel to the Lodge.** A Forbes Five-Star SoCal property went from zero to nightly programming. Proves it's possible to add entertainment to a property that never had it (or had minimal programming). |

### Case 4: Rosewood Hotel Georgia (Vancouver)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Dark period | Renovation/transition period |
| Trigger for restart | Reopening under Rosewood brand |
| Outcome | **Branded program created** — "1927 Lobby Live" (named for original year, live music in lobby) |
| Relevance | Shows how a new management team can create a branded entertainment program tied to property heritage — exactly what PFE proposes for the Lodge's Craftsman aesthetic. |

### Case 5: Four Seasons Biltmore Santa Barbara

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Dark period | Closed since November 2020 (5+ years) |
| Trigger for dark | COVID closure + extended renovation |
| Trigger for restart | Reopening planned 2026 |
| Outcome | **Expected to restart.** Had Spanish guitar (Chris Fossek) and other entertainment pre-closure. Reopening will almost certainly include entertainment. |
| Relevance | When this property reopens with entertainment in 2026, the Lodge will be even more isolated as the only dark Five Diamond property in SoCal. |

### Case 6: Langham Hotels (Brand-Level)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Dark period | Varied by property |
| Trigger for restart | Created a new corporate role: "Director of Music" |
| Outcome | **Organizational upgrade** — entertainment elevated from ad-hoc to having a dedicated corporate executive |
| Relevance | Shows the trend is toward formalizing entertainment, not eliminating it. |

### The Pattern

| Case | Dark Duration | Outcome | Entertainment Level After |
|------|--------------|---------|--------------------------|
| Tonga Room | ~16 months | Same format restored | Same |
| Arizona Biltmore | ~8 years | Upgrade | Higher |
| San Ysidro Ranch | N/A (zero → active) | New program created | New |
| Rosewood Hotel Georgia | Renovation | Branded program | New branded |
| FS Biltmore | 5+ years (ongoing) | Expected restart | Expected |
| Langham | Varied | New Director of Music | Upgraded |

**Conclusion: Dark + new leadership = entertainment UPGRADE, not elimination.** No property in this study went dark and stayed dark by choice (excluding nature retreats). The Lodge's dark period combined with Oscar's arrival as new F&B Director matches the exact pattern that historically triggers entertainment restarts or upgrades.

| Phase | Timing | What Happens |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Strategic planning** | August-September | GM and department heads set priorities for next fiscal year |
| **Budget drafting** | September-October | F&B Director drafts entertainment line items (or doesn't) |
| **Budget approval** | October-December | Final budgets approved by ownership/corporate |
| **Procurement** | January-March | Vendor selection, contracts, scheduling for summer |
| **Programming launch** | April-June | Summer entertainment season begins |

### The Lodge's Current Situation

- Oscar Gonzalez started August 2025.
- The Lodge's 2026 budget was set with **zero entertainment** — Oscar either wasn't involved in budget decisions yet or chose not to allocate.
- However, entertainment at the Lodge has historically been an **operational expense** handled at F&B Director discretion, not a formal capital budget item.
- Oscar can activate entertainment as an operational decision without waiting for the next budget cycle.

### February-March 2026: "Just in Time" Window

| Signal | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Grand Del Mar | Already published summer 2026 dates — competitors are 2-3 months ahead |
| Rancho Bernardo Inn | Year-round nightly programming — no seasonal gap to exploit |
| Estancia La Jolla | 6-7 nights/week year-round — already established |
| Park Hyatt Aviara | Nightly lobby music + annual Jazz at the Park series |
| Industry norm | Entertainment vendors typically need 4-8 weeks lead time for regular programming |
| Budget reality | Past formal budget cycle but before summer season — entertainment decision is operational, not capital |

**Assessment:** February-March 2026 is the **optimal outreach window** for PFE. It is:
- **After** Oscar has settled in (6+ months in role)
- **After** the formal budget cycle (so it's a fresh operational decision, not a budget fight)
- **Before** the summer season (4-5 months of lead time)
- **Before** competitors lock in summer calendars (Grand Del Mar already publishing)
- **Exactly when** the "we should do something for summer" conversation happens

### Vendor Procurement at Luxury Properties

- No formal RFP process documented at any property for entertainment.
- Entertainment is typically F&B Director discretion, not a procurement process.
- Most properties use either (a) a single vendor relationship (e.g., Acoustic Spot in SD), (b) a direct performer relationship (e.g., named residencies), or (c) a combination.
- The decision is personal and relationship-driven — which favors PFE's direct outreach to Oscar.
