## Relevant Context That Could Affect Cell Service

### Location Factors
- The Bahia Resort Hotel sits on a **14-acre peninsula** jutting into Mission Bay (998 W Mission Bay Dr, San Diego, CA 92109)
- Water surroundings on three sides could theoretically create signal reflection/interference
- The property is in a **low-rise, open area** — no tall buildings to block signal, but also fewer nearby cell towers compared to dense urban zones

### Nearby Coverage Issues
- A Verizon Community Forum post reported a persistent **dead zone in zip code 92117** (Clairemont, the neighboring zip to 92109), where a user's signal dropped from 4 bars to 1 bar starting in August 2019
- No similar reports were found for 92109 (Mission Bay) itself

### Coastal Coverage Notes
- Multiple sources note that **coverage weakens along the San Diego coast** compared to inland areas
- 5G-capable phones may experience **spotty coverage** in parts of San Diego because they attempt to connect to a weak 5G signal instead of falling back to stronger 4G LTE — this is a known issue across San Diego, not specific to the Bahia

### General San Diego Carrier Rankings
- **AT&T**: Generally rated best in San Diego for reliability and 5G
- **Verizon**: Best overall area coverage (99.9% of the city), strong 5G Ultra Wideband in select locations
- **T-Mobile**: Third in coverage (98.8%), but leading in 5G network breadth

- $48/night resort fee

---
