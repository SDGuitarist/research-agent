# Report 1 — Batch 3: National Five Diamond / Five Star Peers
## Live Music & Entertainment Programming (2025–2026)

**Date:** February 23, 2026
**Batch:** 3 of 8 (Tier 2 — National Five Diamond / Five Star Peers, Properties #18–27)
**Classification:** PFE Strategic Intelligence

## Critical Findings: Batch 3 Headlines

### 1. Eight of Ten National Peers Program Entertainment — The Lodge's Zero Is an Outlier at Every Tier
**8 of 10 national Five Diamond / Five Star peers** have some form of entertainment programming. The only two with zero — Post Ranch Inn (39 rooms, Big Sur cliff retreat) and Blackberry Mountain (wellness/adventure) — are deliberately positioned as nature-disconnection properties where silence IS the experience. Every traditional luxury resort in this batch programs entertainment. The Lodge at Torrey Pines, a 170-room Five Diamond resort with multiple restaurants and a pool bar, has no such positioning excuse.

### 2. Fine Dining Music Exists at the National Level — First Confirmed Case
**Kiawah Island's Ocean Room** (Forbes Five-Star steakhouse) programs **live piano music on Friday and Saturday evenings**. This is the **first confirmed regular fine dining restaurant entertainment** found across all three batches (27 properties). Nemacolin's Lautrec (Five-Star/Five Diamond) also had dinner music ("passionate vocal classics") but is currently closed for renovation. The "zero fine dining music" finding from SoCal is nearly universal — but not absolute.

### 3. The Breakers Has a 10+ Year DJ Residency — Proof That Long-Term Entertainment Investment Works
DJ UKi (Kirill Basov) has been the **Entertainment Director and Resident DJ at The Breakers' HMF for 10+ years**, programming curated music **365 nights per year**. He holds an executive title, runs a production company (UKi Productions), and segments music by daypart (cocktail → dinner → lounge). This is the closest national parallel to PFE's proposed model — a single named entertainment authority embedded in the F&B operation.

### 4. Montage Deer Valley Is Far More Extensive Than Round 1 Suggested
Round 1 found "Music at Montage nightly, Vista Lounge." The reality: **three distinct entertainment venues** (Vista Lounge nightly musicians, Apres Lounge daily DJ with Veuve Clicquot partnership, Alpine Pool Deck summer), **named performers** (Angie Petty, DJ Cam Reeve, DJ Bentley, DJ Base from LA), **cultural programming** (Utah Opera, Ballet West intimate performances), and a **dedicated Director of Programming (Malia Robinson)**. This is a full entertainment operation with brand partnerships and imported talent.

### 5. Bagpiper Traditions at Two Five Diamond Resorts — Signature Cultural Programming
Both **Sea Island** and **Nemacolin** feature **daily/weekend bagpiper traditions** — strolling musicians on golf course paths and resort grounds. These are signature cultural experiences, not ambient background music. Sea Island publishes exact seasonal sunset times for their bagpiper. This model — a single distinctive instrument as a property signature — is conceptually what PFE proposes with Spanish guitar.

### 6. Blackberry Farm's Concert Model Is Unique — $650–$1,700/Person Event Add-Ons
Blackberry Farm programs **3–5 major concert weekends per year** (Emmylou Harris, Little Big Town, Dave Matthews, Brandi Carlile) at Bramble Hall, bundled with multi-night stays. Tickets are **$650–$1,700+ per person event add-ons** on top of $1,000+/night room rates. All proceeds benefit the Blackberry Farm Foundation. This is entertainment as ultra-premium experience and philanthropy — a completely different model from ambient lounge music.

### 22. Blackberry Mountain — Walland, TN

**Rating:** Luxury (Relais & Chateaux). Sister property to Blackberry Farm, opened 2019.
**Entertainment Status:** NO PROGRAMMING FOUND

| Field | Detail |

| Status | **ZERO live entertainment** |
| Context | 5,200-acre wellness/adventure property. 3-night minimum stay, registered guests only. Evening experience defined by: fine dining (Three Sisters, Firetower), fire pit/s'mores, stargazing. Sound bath (wellness, not entertainment) and art studio classes are the closest to "programming." |

**Blackberry Mountain Total:** ZERO. Nature-retreat positioning makes this a deliberate brand choice, not an oversight.

**Stein Eriksen Total:** Ambient music "most evenings" during ski season at Troll Hallen + Sunday brunch jazz + 6 summer Hops on the Hill events. **Minimal for a Five-Star property.** Brand identity built on luxury, fine dining, and mountain heritage — entertainment is deliberately understated.

#### NYE: Multi-venue
- Vista Lounge: Live jazz (9 PM–midnight, 21+)
- Rivalry Room: Ultra-lounge transformation with DJ
- Empire Ballroom: Family-friendly DJ + buffet + champagne toast

**Montage Deer Valley Total:** **Nightly live musicians at Vista Lounge (365/year) + daily DJ at Apres Lounge (ski season) + summer pool music + cultural programming (Opera, Ballet) + Sundance activations + NYE multi-venue.** The most comprehensive entertainment operation of any mountain resort in this study. Director of Programming is a dedicated executive role.

**Is "Music at Montage" a brand program?** Partially. The "12 Days of Montage" holiday concept runs across properties (confirmed at Deer Valley and Palmetto Bluff). But the "Live at Montage" series, Veuve Clicquot partnership, and nightly Vista Lounge programming appear property-specific to Deer Valley.

- **Easter:** The Circle: harpist + guitarist ($285/pp); Ponce de Leon Ballroom: live trio ($285/pp)
- **Christmas/New Year's Day:** Live string instrumentals at The Circle brunch ($285/pp)
- **Family:** Silent disco, carnival acts, movie nights (seasonal)

#### Venues with NO Entertainment
- Flagler Steakhouse, Seafood Bar, Henry's Palm Beach, The Italian Restaurant, Beach Club, Ocean House, Surf Break — **all no entertainment confirmed**

**The Breakers Total:** **Nightly DJ at HMF (365/year, 10+ year residency) + weekly Sunday harpist + Echo DJ booth + premium holiday programming.** Entertainment is concentrated at HMF rather than distributed across venues. DJ UKi's Entertainment Director title and decade-long tenure make this the most institutionalized entertainment position found in the study.

### 27. Post Ranch Inn — Big Sur, CA

**Rating:** Forbes Five-Star
**Entertainment Status:** NO PROGRAMMING — deliberate nature-retreat positioning

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Status | **ZERO live entertainment** |
| Context | 39 rooms, 100 acres of Pacific cliffside. Rooms have no TVs by design. In-room Bose speakers for guest-selected music. Emphasis on natural sounds (ocean, wind, birdsong) as the "entertainment." $2,139+/night |
| Programming | Sound healing meditation (singing bowls, weekly), nightly stargazing, guided art walk with champagne, Soulful Journey retreat (shamanic sessions with Resident Shaman Rob Somers), falconry |
| Fine dining | Sierra Mar — MICHELIN Guide listed, Wine Spectator Grand Award. **No live entertainment.** |
| Source | [postranchinn.com](https://postranchinn.com/) — Tier 2 |
| Notes | **Deliberate brand choice.** A TripAdvisor reviewer suggested "an early evening casual sunset happy hour with live music" — confirming it doesn't exist and guests have noticed. Remote Big Sur location also makes talent logistics challenging. |

**Post Ranch Inn Total:** ZERO. Like Blackberry Mountain, this is a deliberate nature-disconnection positioning. The 39-room scale and Big Sur remoteness make this fundamentally different from the Lodge at Torrey Pines (170 rooms, La Jolla, multiple restaurants and bars).

## Properties with Fine Dining Restaurant Music

### Cumulative Across All Three Batches (27 Properties)

| Property | Restaurant | Music? | Details |
|----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Kiawah Island | Ocean Room (Forbes 5⭐ steakhouse) | **YES — Fri-Sat piano** | First confirmed regular fine dining dinner music |
| Nemacolin | Lautrec (Forbes 5⭐ + AAA 5💎) | **WAS YES — CLOSED** | Had "passionate vocal classics" during dinner |
| San Ysidro Ranch | Stonehouse | **YES — Spanish guitar (brunch + possibly dinner)** | From Batch 2 |
| Rosewood Miramar | Caruso's (Michelin 1⭐) | **UNCONFIRMED** | Baby grand piano present; live pianist unverified |
| Terranea | Mar'sel | **Sunday brunch only** | No dinner music |
| Estancia La Jolla | Mustangs & Burros | **YES (casual, not fine dining)** | Tue-Sat |
| **All other 21 properties** | Fine dining restaurants | **NO** | — |

**The fine dining music gap holds across the national landscape.** Only 2-3 properties out of 27 have any form of regular dinner entertainment in their signature restaurant. A.R. Valentien with live Spanish guitar would be rare nationally, not just in SoCal.

## DELIVERABLE B — PFE Executive Summary (Batch 3)

### The National Picture: Entertainment Is Standard at Five Diamond Resorts

**8 of 10 national Five Diamond / Five Star peers program some form of live entertainment.** The only two with zero (Post Ranch Inn, Blackberry Mountain) are deliberately positioned as nature-disconnection retreats — 39-room Big Sur cliff resort and wellness mountain, respectively. Neither has a bar, lounge, or social gathering space designed for entertainment.

The Lodge at Torrey Pines — a 170-room Five Diamond resort with a lobby, bar, pool, two restaurants, and a fire pit patio — has no such positioning excuse. Among traditional luxury resorts of comparable size and format, **zero entertainment is an anomaly at every level: local (7/8 San Diego), regional (8/9 SoCal), and national (8/10 Five Diamond peers).**

### Cumulative Score: 23 of 27 Properties Program Entertainment

| Tier | Properties | Active Entertainment | Dark / Closed | Zero |
|------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|------|
| Tier 0 — San Diego | 8 | **7** | 0 | 1 (Lodge) |
| Tier 1 — SoCal | 9 | **8** | 1 (FS Biltmore closed) | 0 |
| Tier 2 — National | 10 | **8** | 0 | 2 (nature retreats) |
| **Total** | **27** | **23** | **1** | **3** |

Of those 3 with zero: 1 is closed for renovation (had entertainment), 2 are nature retreats. **The Lodge is the only traditional luxury resort with zero entertainment across all 27 properties.**

### The Breakers Parallel — DJ UKi as Proof of Long-Term Residency ROI

DJ UKi has been the **Entertainment Director at The Breakers' HMF for 10+ years**, programming music 365 nights per year. He holds an executive title and runs the production company that manages all musical programming. This is the closest national parallel to what PFE proposes — a single named entertainment authority embedded in the F&B operation, not a rotating roster of anonymous performers. If The Breakers can sustain this for a decade at a $1,200/person NYE venue, the Lodge can sustain a Spanish guitar residency.

### Montage Deer Valley — The Mountain Resort Entertainment Standard

Montage Deer Valley operates **nightly live music at Vista Lounge, daily DJ sets at the Apres Lounge (Veuve Clicquot partnership), summer pool deck music, cultural programming with Utah Opera and Ballet West, Sundance activations, and multi-venue NYE programming.** They have a **Director of Programming** and fly DJs from Los Angeles monthly. If a mountain resort in Utah can support this level of entertainment investment, a coastal California Five Diamond resort certainly can.

### Batch 3 Data Points for the Oscar Email

1. **8 of 10 national Five Diamond peers** program entertainment — the two without are nature retreats (39-room Big Sur, wellness mountain). The Lodge is the only traditional resort at zero.
2. **The Breakers Palm Beach** has maintained a **resident Entertainment Director (DJ UKi) for 10+ years**, programming **365 nights/year** — proof that long-term entertainment investment works at the Five Diamond tier.
3. **Montage Deer Valley** runs **nightly live music, daily DJ sets with Veuve Clicquot branding, and cultural programming** with Utah Opera and Ballet West — with a **dedicated Director of Programming** role.
4. **Sea Island** (the only resort worldwide with four Forbes Five-Star ratings for 13+ years) programs a **daily sunset bagpiper tradition + year-round lobby pianist + 3 nights/week wine bar entertainment**.
5. **Nemacolin** built a **dedicated entertainment venue (Nightcap)** with a $50 table fee model that drives F&B revenue — entertainment as revenue strategy, not just cost center.
6. **Kiawah Island's Ocean Room** (Forbes Five-Star steakhouse) has **live piano Fri–Sat** — the only confirmed regular fine dining dinner music nationally. Fine dining music is rare but it exists. A.R. Valentien would still be a differentiator.
7. **Blackberry Farm** books **Emmylou Harris, Little Big Town, and Dave Matthews** for concert weekends at **$650–$1,700 per person** as event add-ons — entertainment at the highest price point in luxury hospitality.
8. **Cumulative across 27 properties:** 23 program entertainment, 1 is closed (had it), 2 are nature retreats with zero. **The Lodge is the only outlier.**

### Updated Competitive Positioning Language

> "We've now surveyed 27 luxury properties — every San Diego competitor, every SoCal luxury resort, and every national Five Diamond peer from Sea Island to The Breakers to Montage Deer Valley. Twenty-three of twenty-seven program live entertainment. The three that don't include a 39-room Big Sur cliff retreat, a wellness mountain, and the Lodge at Torrey Pines. The Breakers has maintained a resident Entertainment Director for over a decade. Sea Island plays a sunset bagpiper every single day. Montage Deer Valley flies DJs in from Los Angeles monthly. The Lodge is the only traditional Five Diamond resort in America with zero. And still — no competitor programs music in their fine dining room. A signature Spanish guitar residency at A.R. Valentien wouldn't just close the gap. It would put the Lodge in a category of one."
