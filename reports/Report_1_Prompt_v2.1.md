**Prompt Version:** 2.1
**Date:** February 23, 2026
**Designed for:** Deep research tools (Perplexity Pro, Grok Deep Research, ChatGPT Deep Research, or similar)
**Changes from v2.0:** San Diego competitors elevated to Tier 0, Oscar Gonzalez's former properties added as search targets, execution batches defined, review platform mining instruction added, performer/vendor capture field added, "properties that went dark" sub-question added, seasonal planning timeline question added, specific trade pub search strings provided, Instagram workaround integrated, research context from reconnaissance dossier included

## Research Context (Read Before Starting)

This intelligence is being gathered for a luxury entertainment company (Pacific Flow Entertainment) positioning itself as a cultural programming partner to a AAA Five Diamond resort property — The Lodge at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, California.

**Key facts that shape what we're looking for:**

1. The Lodge has been **dark** (zero live entertainment across the entire property) for 4+ months, since approximately November 2025.
2. The property previously ran live music **4 nights per week** across two restaurants for nearly a decade (2016–2025) before all programming was cut during a period of leadership turnover.
3. A **new F&B Director, Oscar Gonzalez**, was hired in August 2025. His career includes: Ritz-Carlton (early career), Four Seasons (twice), SLS Las Vegas, Pelican Hill, Fairmont San Francisco (Executive Chef, 2016–2023), Hard Rock Hotel New York (Executive Chef then F&B Director, 2023–2024). He ran his own consultancy (Behind The Lines Hospitality) focused on venue audits, menu engineering, and revenue strategy before joining the Lodge.
4. A concierge at the Lodge indicated entertainment won't return until "probably summertime" — meaning programming decisions have not been finalized yet.
5. OpenTable ranks The Lodge's casual restaurant (The Grill) as the **#1 live music restaurant** in its area despite having zero live music — a concrete guest expectation gap.
6. The Lodge's two sister properties (Catamaran Resort and Bahia Resort, both Evans Hotels) currently program live entertainment while the flagship Five Diamond property does not.
7. The research needs to establish: **(a)** what peer properties are doing, **(b)** what Oscar Gonzalez likely saw at his previous properties, and **(c)** data points that make the case for live entertainment as ROI-positive at a luxury resort.

## Scope (Expanded)

This report covers **ALL music activations across the full property footprint** of luxury hotels — not just restaurant dining rooms. The goal is to map the complete landscape of how luxury properties are using live music as a strategic asset.

- Patio, terrace, and outdoor dining music
- Pool and cabana programming
- Lobby music (live, not piped-in playlists)

## Focus Areas

### 1. Residency Programs
Which properties have a dedicated performer or ensemble on a recurring schedule? What does the residency look like — same nights weekly, seasonal contracts, artist-in-residence? How long has the residency been running? Is the performer named/branded or anonymous? What's the venue — restaurant, lounge, lobby, pool?

### 2. Lobby and Arrival Experience
Which properties use live music as part of the arrival or lobby experience? How is it integrated — background or featured element? What genre? Is it daily, weekends only, seasonal? Does the lobby music extend into adjacent dining spaces?

### 3. Pool and Outdoor Programming
Any live music at pool areas, gardens, or outdoor lounges? Seasonal or year-round? What format — acoustic solo, duo, ensemble? Is it tied to food/beverage service? Any "sunset session" or branded outdoor music series?

### 4. Restaurant and Patio Dining
Live music integrated into the dining experience. Background acoustic, featured performances, chef's table pairings, wine dinner accompaniment. Which restaurants within the property have music and which don't? Is there a difference between the fine dining room and the casual restaurant?

### 5. Lounge and Bar Entertainment
Live music in hotel bars and lounges. Jazz, cocktail piano, acoustic sets. Schedule and format. Is the lounge entertainment seen as a draw (guests come specifically for it) or ambient (accompaniment to drinking)?

### 6. One-Off Events and Marketing Activations
Special themed evenings, seasonal concerts, holiday programming, brand partnerships involving music. Any "signature series" that has become part of the property's identity (like Grand Del Mar's Supper Club Under the Stars)? Any concerts, pop-ups, or collaborations with local music organizations?

### 7. Cultural Programs
Artist-in-residence programs, community music partnerships, heritage or cultural storytelling through music, educational programming. Any properties partnering with local arts organizations? Any cultural programming tied to the property's identity or location?

### 8. Brand-Level Initiatives
Are any luxury hotel brands running entertainment programming as a corporate standard or cross-property initiative? Any brand playbooks, brand standards documents, or corporate mandates regarding live entertainment? Any brand-level partnerships with entertainment companies or music organizations?

### 9. Executive Voices
Search hospitality trade publications directly using these specific queries:

- `site:skift.com "live music" luxury hotel`
- `site:skift.com "live entertainment" hotel dining`
- `site:hotelmanagement.net "live entertainment" OR "live music" dining`
- `site:hospitalitydesign.com music entertainment restaurant hotel`
- `site:lodgingmagazine.com entertainment programming`
- `site:hotelbusiness.com "live music" OR "live entertainment"`
- `"F&B director" OR "food and beverage director" "live music" OR "live entertainment" luxury hotel 2025`
- `"general manager" "live music" luxury resort "guest experience" 2025`

Also search LinkedIn for posts from F&B Directors, GMs, or brand executives at properties on the hit list discussing live entertainment strategy. Any 2025–2026 quotes about the role of music in guest experience, F&B strategy, or property differentiation.

### 10. Properties with NO Music Programming
**Just as valuable as finding programming.** Which luxury properties on this list have zero live entertainment? Has anyone recently discontinued music? Any public commentary about why? This establishes context for the Lodge's current dark status — is it unusual, or is it part of a broader trend?

### 11. Properties That Went Dark and Restarted
Which luxury properties previously had regular live music programming and then discontinued it? What happened? Did they restart? How long was the gap? What triggered the restart — new leadership, guest feedback, competitive pressure, seasonal reset? This pattern (programming → dark period → restart) is directly relevant to the Lodge's current situation.

### 12. Seasonal Planning Timeline
When do luxury resort properties typically make entertainment programming decisions for summer season? What's the lead time? Are RFPs issued, or is it F&B Director discretion? Any evidence of when properties lock in their summer entertainment calendar? Any industry norms for entertainment vendor procurement at luxury properties?

---

## Review Platform Mining (Critical)

For each property on the hit list, search:

- **OpenTable:** `[property restaurant name] live music` — check if the listing mentions live entertainment, and read 5–10 recent reviews for music mentions
- **Yelp:** `[property name] live music` — check recent reviews
- **TripAdvisor:** `[property name] live music` OR `entertainment` — check recent reviews
- **Google Reviews:** `[property name] live music` — check recent reviews

Guest reviews are often the most current and honest indicator of what's actually happening on the ground — more reliable than property websites, which may be stale (as proven by The Lodge's own stale listings).

**Flag any properties where online listings claim live music but reviews suggest otherwise.** This is the "Lodge problem" — OpenTable ranking a property for live music that doesn't exist — and identifying it at other properties is valuable competitive intelligence.

## Deliverable B — PFE Executive Summary (1–2 Pages)

After completing the full report, produce a separate executive summary answering:

1. **Landscape snapshot:** What percentage of Five Diamond/Five Star properties on this list program live entertainment? What's the most common activation model?

2. **San Diego competitive gap:** What are the 8 San Diego direct competitors doing with entertainment? How does the Lodge's current "dark" status compare? Is the Lodge an outlier?

3. **Oscar Gonzalez's frame of reference:** Based on what entertainment programming exists (or existed) at his former properties (Pelican Hill, Fairmont San Francisco, Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton, SLS Las Vegas, Hard Rock Hotel), what does Oscar likely consider "normal" for a luxury property? What has he seen work?

4. **Activation models PFE could propose:** Based on the landscape scan, what are the 3–5 most relevant activation models for a Five Diamond resort in Southern California with a fire pit patio, fine dining room, pool bar, and Craftsman lodge aesthetic?

5. **Data points for the Oscar email:** List the 5–10 most compelling statistics, quotes, or examples from this research that would strengthen a concise outreach email to a new F&B Director at a Five Diamond property. Prioritize: peer property comparisons, revenue/ROI data, guest satisfaction metrics, and "everyone else is doing this" competitive pressure.

6. **Competitive positioning language:** What language and framing emerges from this landscape scan that Pacific Flow Entertainment should use to describe its value proposition? What do luxury properties call this — "cultural programming," "signature entertainment," "live music residency," "entertainment curation"? What vocabulary does the industry use?

7. **Timing intelligence:** Based on seasonal planning findings, is the current window (February–March 2026) the right time to reach out for summer programming? Is it early, on time, or late?

## Execution Batches (For Research Tool Operators)

This prompt is too long for any single research query. Break execution into these batches:

| Batch | Focus | Properties | Recommended Method |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Batch 1** | San Diego direct competitors | #1–8 (Tier 0) | Individual property searches — highest priority, most actionable for PFE |
| **Batch 2** | SoCal luxury resorts | #9–17 (Tier 1) | Individual property searches — focus on entertainment/events pages |
| **Batch 3** | National Five Diamond peers | #18–27 (Tier 2) | Individual property searches or deep research tool with focused query |
| **Batch 4** | Independent luxury comparables | #28–33 (Tier 3) | Individual property searches — look for parallels to Evans Hotels (family-owned, non-chain) |
| **Batch 5** | Oscar's former properties | #34–39 (Tier 4) | Individual property searches — focus on what entertainment existed during his tenure |
| **Batch 6** | Brand-level scan | #40–46 (Tier 5) | Broad queries per brand + corporate press releases |
| **Batch 7** | Executive voices + trade pubs | N/A | Use specific search strings listed in Focus Area #9 |
| **Batch 8** | Seasonal planning + dark-to-restart patterns | N/A | Trade pub searches + industry articles |

**For each batch, the core research query should be under 400 characters.** Example for Batch 1:

> "Fairmont Grand Del Mar live music entertainment programming 2025 2026 restaurant lounge pool bar"

Then repeat for each property in the batch.
