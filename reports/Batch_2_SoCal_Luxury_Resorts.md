# Report 1 — Batch 2: SoCal Luxury Resorts
## Live Music & Entertainment Programming (2025–2026)

**Date:** February 23, 2026
**Batch:** 2 of 8 (Tier 1 — Southern California Luxury Resorts, Properties #9–17)
**Classification:** PFE Strategic Intelligence

---

## Critical Findings: Batch 2 Headlines

### 1. Every Active SoCal Luxury Resort Programs Live Entertainment
**8 of 9 properties** on this list actively program live music. The only exception — Four Seasons Biltmore Santa Barbara — has been **closed since March 2020** for renovation and had 4-night/week live music when it was open. When it reopens (expected summer 2026), entertainment programming is expected to resume. The Lodge at Torrey Pines is not just a San Diego outlier — it's a SoCal-wide outlier.

### 2. The Montage Laguna Beach Residency Model Is the Gold Standard
Steve Siu has been the **resident pianist at Montage Laguna Beach for 22+ years** — since the resort's 2003 opening. He plays **365 days a year, ~50 hours/week**, including marathon Sunday sessions (1 PM–11 PM). CEO Alan Fuerstman hand-picked him and called him "the best pianist I've ever had the pleasure to work with in my entire career in the hospitality business." David Allen Baker complements him as the evening vocalist/instrumentalist (Tue–Sat). **This is the closest existing model to what PFE proposes for the Lodge.**

### 3. Spanish Guitar Already Exists at Two Luxury Competitors
- **Ojai Valley Inn:** Aaron Copenhaguen plays Spanish/flamenco guitar every Thursday at the Wallace Neff Heritage Bar
- **Four Seasons Biltmore (pre-closure):** Chris Fossek played Spanish/flamenco guitar every Wednesday and Saturday at the Ty Lounge — and is booked through **Acoustic Spot**
- **San Ysidro Ranch:** Live Spanish guitarist at Stonehouse during brunch and dinner

This validates Spanish guitar as an accepted luxury resort genre — and means Oscar Gonzalez has likely experienced it at his former Four Seasons properties.

### 4. Zero Fine Dining Restaurants Program Live Music
Consistent with Batch 1, **no fine dining restaurant in this batch has live entertainment**: Studio Mediterranean (Montage), Olivella (Ojai Valley Inn), Bourbon Steak (Monarch Beach), Caruso's (Rosewood — has a baby grand piano, unclear if live pianist), Andrea (Pelican Hill — closed since 2020 but previously had live guitar), RAYA (Ritz-Carlton). **The A.R. Valentien opportunity remains unique across the entire SoCal luxury market.**

### 5. Pelican Hill Is Becoming a St. Regis — and Oscar Saw It With Live Music
Pelican Hill is undergoing a **$200M renovation** to become "The Resort at Pelican Hill, A St. Regis Estate" in 2027. When Oscar Gonzalez worked there (pre-2016), Andrea Ristorante featured live acoustic Italian/Spanish guitar, annual Festa dell'Autunno with live musicians and dancers, and Great Room entertainment. **Oscar's baseline for "normal" includes fine-dining live guitar — exactly what PFE offers.**

### 6. Acoustic Spot's Reach Is Limited Outside San Diego
Acoustic Spot has connections to Pelican Hill and Montage Laguna Beach (musician bios list these as past venues) and books Chris Fossek at Four Seasons Biltmore. But their formal venue partnerships are concentrated in San Diego County. **Rosewood, San Ysidro Ranch, Ojai Valley Inn, Terranea, Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel, and Monarch Beach do NOT use Acoustic Spot.** These properties use different entertainment models.

#### Venue: AMA Sushi (REST) — NO ENTERTAINMENT

#### Holiday/Seasonal Events:
- **Merry Miramar** (December): Live entertainment, children's activities
- **Le Bal Cristal** (NYE): Gala with live entertainment and dancing under Baccarat chandeliers
- **The Grimm Manor** (Halloween): Themed DJ night

**Rosewood Miramar Beach Total:** 2–3 entertainment nights/week (Fri–Sat confirmed, Thursday unclear) at Manor Bar + possible nightly piano at Caruso's + seasonal events. **The Manor Bar positions itself as the Montecito entertainment destination** — "the only place in Montecito presenting weekly live music."

### 15. Four Seasons Resort The Biltmore Santa Barbara — Santa Barbara, CA

**Rating:** Forbes Five-Star (pre-closure)
**Entertainment Status:** CLOSED — property shut since March 2020. Reopening expected late spring/early summer 2026.
**Oscar Connection:** Gonzalez worked at Four Seasons twice in his career. This property's entertainment is what he considers "normal" for the brand.

#### Venue: Ty Lounge (LNG — pre-closure)
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Type of music | **Spanish/flamenco guitar** (Wed & Sat) + **Jazz vocals** (Fri) + local live music (Thu) |
| Performer/vendor | **Chris Fossek** (Spanish/flamenco guitarist — Santa Barbara native, studied in Bologna and Valencia, Billboard Top-Ten charting, booked through **Acoustic Spot**); **Lois Mahalia** (jazz/soul vocalist — former backing vocalist for Kenny Loggins, Joe Sample; Guyana-born, SB-based) |
| Schedule | **Wednesday: 5–8 PM (Fossek, Spanish guitar). Thursday: 7–10 PM (local live music). Friday: 7–10 PM (Lois Mahalia, jazz). Saturday: 5–8 PM (Fossek) + 7–10 PM (local act)** |

#### Venue: Bella Vista (Fine Dining) — BEING REPLACED BY NOBU
- No regular live entertainment (NYE exception — annual gala with live entertainment and dancing)
- **Nobu Santa Barbara** will replace Bella Vista upon reopening — one of only three Four Seasons worldwide with Nobu

#### 2026 Reopening Changes:
- $100M+ renovation. New theater space (could signal expanded entertainment)
- Nobu replacing Bella Vista. Coral Casino no longer accessible to hotel guests
- New pool complexes (3,557 sq ft family pool with lazy river + adults-only pool)
- Reduced room count (138 from ~207)

**What Oscar Gonzalez experienced at Four Seasons:**
- **4-night/week live music in a single lounge venue (Ty Lounge)**
- **Spanish/flamenco guitar** as a recurring format (Chris Fossek, Wed & Sat)
- **Jazz vocalist** as a named residency (Lois Mahalia, Fridays)
- Intimate, acoustic-forward programming — no bands, no DJs (except NYE)
- **Local artists with professional credentials**, not touring national acts
- **This is likely Oscar's mental model for "what a luxury resort does"**

**Four Seasons Biltmore Total:** CURRENTLY ZERO (closed). Pre-closure: 4 nights/week at Ty Lounge. Reopening 2026 — entertainment programming will almost certainly be redesigned. New theater space is a signal.

### 16. San Ysidro Ranch — Santa Barbara/Montecito, CA

**Rating:** Ultra-luxury (Ty Warner property). 41 rooms on 500+ acres.
**Entertainment Status:** ACTIVE — **surprisingly robust for a 41-room property. Nightly live jazz.**

#### Venue: The Speakeasy (formerly Plow & Angel — LNG)
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Type of music | Jazz (primary), lounge/crooner style. Guitarist + pianist core duo |
| Performer/vendor | Rotating roster of unnamed local jazz musicians. "Dean Martin-style lounge singer and pianist accompanist" documented at NYE. **Three musicians brought in each day** across the property |
| Schedule | **Sunday–Thursday: 7:00 PM–11:00 PM. Friday–Saturday: 7:00 PM–midnight. SEVEN NIGHTS A WEEK** |
| Format | ROT (Rotating roster, nightly) |
| Purpose | AMB + MKT (core identity of the 2024 Speakeasy rebrand) |

| Notes | **The 2024 Speakeasy rebrand made nightly live music a defining feature — a deliberate strategic investment.** Prior to this, Plow & Angel had no documented regular entertainment. This is a recent "dark to active" transition, directly relevant to the Lodge's situation. |

#### Venue: The Speakeasy — Spin After Dark (LNG)
| Field | Detail |

| Type of music | Live DJ with dancing |

| Schedule | **Sunday Champagne Brunch: 10:00 AM–1:30 PM** (garden patio). **Dinner service: 5:00–9:00 PM** (likely regular but not confirmed nightly) |
| Admission | Sunday brunch: $115–$275/person depending on date |

| Notes | **Spanish guitar at a fine dining restaurant — during brunch and possibly dinner. This is rare and directly relevant to PFE.** |

#### Holiday Events:
- **Valentine's Day 2026:** Brunch with live guitar + dinner with **live harpist** + additional music ($425/pp dinner)
- **NYE 2025/2026:** Guitarist in Caviar Lounge + "Dean Martin-style" lounge singer at Speakeasy
- **Halloween 2024:** Live music + psychic readings at Speakeasy

**San Ysidro Ranch Total:** **7 nights/week** at The Speakeasy + **weekly DJ night** + **Sunday brunch guitarist** + **regular dinner music at Stonehouse** + enhanced holiday programming. **~3 musicians per day.** A 41-room property programs more entertainment than the 170-room Lodge at Torrey Pines (zero). This is perhaps the most damning comparison in the dataset.

## Activation Patterns (Batch 2)

### Frequency Distribution
- **Daily / 365 days:** Montage Laguna Beach (Lobby Lounge)
- **Nightly / 7 nights:** Terranea (Lobby Bar + Casamigos), San Ysidro Ranch (Speakeasy)
- **5+ nights:** Pelican Hill (Great Room mix + Grill)
- **4-5 nights:** Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel (multi-venue)
- **3 nights:** Ojai Valley Inn (3 distinct programs)
- **2-3 nights:** Rosewood Miramar Beach (Manor Bar Fri-Sat + possible Thu)
- **2+ nights:** Monarch Beach (33 North + Lobby; conflicting data)
- **ZERO (closed):** Four Seasons Biltmore (reopening 2026)
- **ZERO:** Lodge at Torrey Pines

### Most Common Venue Type
**Lounge/Bar** dominates (9 of 9 properties with entertainment have lounge/bar programming). Restaurant-integrated music exists only at:
- Terranea: Mar'sel Sunday brunch
- San Ysidro Ranch: Stonehouse brunch + dinner (Spanish guitar)
- Monarch Beach: AVEO weekend breakfast
- Ritz-Carlton: KAHANI (restaurant with entertainment, not traditional fine dining)
- (Rosewood: Caruso's piano — unconfirmed)

**No fine dining dinner service has regular live entertainment.** The pattern holds across all 17 properties searched.

### Residency vs. Rotation
| Model | Properties |
|-------|-----------|
| **True Residency** (same named performer, same schedule) | Montage Laguna Beach (Steve Siu/David Allen Baker), Ojai Valley Inn (3 named artists) |
| **Curated Rotation** (roster of known performers, recurring schedule) | Rosewood Miramar (3 bands), Pelican Hill (5+ vocalists), Terranea (15+ performers), Ritz-Carlton (Joni Llamedo + rotation) |
| **Unnamed Rotation** | San Ysidro Ranch, Monarch Beach, Four Seasons Biltmore (pre-closure) |

### Ticketed/Revenue Events
| Property | Event | Pricing |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Terranea | Sound Series (summer concert) | $30 GA / $500 cabana for 8 |
| Ritz-Carlton | Fever Candlelight Concerts | $50–55/person |
| Ojai Valley Inn | Sunday Bluegrass Brunch | $75/person (prix fixe) |
| San Ysidro Ranch | Sunday Champagne Brunch | $115–275/person |

### Branded Entertainment Series
- **Terranea:** Sound Series (summer), Crabby Sundays
- **Ritz-Carlton:** Fever Candlelight Concert Series
- **Rosewood:** Manor Bar (marketed as "the only live music in Montecito")
- **San Ysidro Ranch:** Spin After Dark (weekly DJ)
- **Monarch Beach:** Soundtrack to Summer, Boots by the Beach, The Address

### Properties with Spanish Guitar Programming
| Property | Performer | Venue | Schedule |
|----------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Ojai Valley Inn | Aaron Copenhaguen | Wallace Neff Heritage Bar | Every Thursday 4-7 PM |
| Four Seasons Biltmore (pre-closure) | Chris Fossek (via Acoustic Spot) | Ty Lounge | Wed & Sat 5-8 PM |
| San Ysidro Ranch | Unnamed | Stonehouse | Sunday brunch + dinner |
| Pelican Hill (pre-2020) | Unnamed | Andrea Ristorante (closed) | During dinner service |

**PFE is not inventing a category. Spanish guitar at luxury SoCal resorts already exists.** But no one is doing it as a signature residency with a named artist. The performers above are unnamed background acts or weekly rotations — not branded cultural programming.

---

## Properties with No Fine Dining Restaurant Music

| Property | Fine Dining Restaurant | Music? |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| Pelican Hill | Andrea (closed) | Had live guitar when open — **CLOSED since 2020** |
| Terranea | Mar'sel | Sunday brunch only — **no dinner music** |
| Montage Laguna Beach | Studio Mediterranean | **NO** (brand new restaurant, no entertainment added) |
| Ritz-Carlton | RAYA | **NO** (coordinates dinner with separate Candlelight concerts) |
| Ojai Valley Inn | Olivella | **NO** |
| Rosewood Miramar | Caruso's | **Baby grand piano present** — unconfirmed if live nightly |
| Four Seasons Biltmore | Bella Vista (→Nobu) | **NO** |
| San Ysidro Ranch | The Stonehouse | **YES (brunch + possibly dinner)** — Spanish guitar |
| Monarch Beach | Bourbon Steak | **NO** |

**Only San Ysidro Ranch has confirmed restaurant-integrated music (brunch + dinner).** Rosewood's Caruso's has a piano but the programming is unconfirmed. The fine dining music gap identified in Batch 1 extends across all of SoCal luxury.

---

## Properties That Recently Changed Entertainment Programming

| Property | Change | When | Significance |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| **San Ysidro Ranch** | Plow & Angel → The Speakeasy. **Zero entertainment → nightly live jazz** | Early 2024 | A 41-room ultra-luxury property made the strategic decision to invest in nightly entertainment as part of a venue rebrand. Dark → active transition directly analogous to the Lodge's opportunity. |
| **Rosewood Miramar** | Expanded Manor Bar program. New Director of Bars, guest bartender series, literary partnership | 2025 | Entertainment investment is increasing, not decreasing, at luxury properties |
| **Pelican Hill** | $200M "Renaissance" renovation → St. Regis Estates rebrand 2027 | Dec 2025 | Major disruption to current programming. King Cole Bar (new) will likely become entertainment anchor. New era. |
| **Four Seasons Biltmore** | Closed since 2020. Reopening 2026 with Nobu, new theater, new pools | Expected summer 2026 | 6-year dark period → restart. Directly relevant pattern. New theater suggests expanded entertainment ambitions. |
| **Montage Laguna Beach** | Mosaic Pool refresh with **new sound system** | May 2025 | Infrastructure investment in entertainment capability |

## DELIVERABLE B — PFE Executive Summary (Batch 2)

### The SoCal Landscape: Universal Entertainment Programming

**8 of 9 SoCal luxury resorts actively program live entertainment. The only closed property (Four Seasons Biltmore) had 4-night/week live music before it shut down and is adding a theater as part of its reopening. The Lodge at Torrey Pines is the only Five Diamond property in Southern California with zero entertainment.**

Combined with Batch 1 (7 of 8 San Diego competitors active), the data now covers **17 properties. 15 actively program entertainment, 1 is closed (but had it), and 1 has zero. The Lodge is that one.**

### The Montage Proof Point

Montage Laguna Beach has operated a **resident pianist (Steve Siu) for 22 consecutive years** — since the resort's opening in 2003. The CEO hand-picked him and calls him the best pianist in his hospitality career. A second performer (David Allen Baker) covers evenings Tuesday through Saturday. This is not a pilot program or an experiment. **The residency model is proven at the highest tier of luxury hospitality.** PFE's proposal for the Lodge mirrors exactly what Montage has run successfully for two decades.

### What Oscar Gonzalez Has Seen

Based on confirmed entertainment at his former properties:

| Oscar's Property | Entertainment He Experienced |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| **Pelican Hill** | Live acoustic Italian/Spanish guitar at Andrea (fine dining), Great Room vocalists nightly, Pelican Grill bands Thu–Sat, annual Italian harvest festival with musicians and dancers |
| **Four Seasons** (×2) | Ty Lounge: Spanish/flamenco guitar (Chris Fossek) Wed & Sat, jazz vocalist (Lois Mahalia) Fri, local music Thu — 4 nights/week in a single lounge |
| **Ritz-Carlton** (early career) | Laguna Niguel property runs 4-5 nights/week across 3 venues + ticketed Candlelight concerts |

**Oscar's baseline for "normal" includes: fine dining guitar, weekly Spanish/flamenco guitar, named artist residencies, and 4+ nights/week of lounge entertainment.** A proposal for a Spanish guitar residency at the Lodge would fit within his professional experience, not stretch beyond it.

### Batch 2 Data Points for the Oscar Email

1. **Montage Laguna Beach** has run a resident pianist **365 days/year for 22 consecutive years** — hand-picked by the CEO.
2. **San Ysidro Ranch** (41 rooms) programs **nightly live jazz** — a property 1/4 the size of the Lodge programs more entertainment.
3. **3 SoCal luxury resorts** already feature Spanish guitar programming (Ojai Valley Inn, Four Seasons Biltmore pre-closure, San Ysidro Ranch) — the genre is validated at the luxury tier.
4. **Pelican Hill** — where Oscar worked — featured **live acoustic guitar in the fine dining room** (Andrea) during his tenure.
5. **Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel** runs a **ticketed Candlelight Concert Series** at $50+/person — entertainment as a revenue line, not just a cost center.
6. **Terranea** programs **nightly year-round music** at two venues + a **$30/ticket summer concert series** that sells cabanas at $500.
7. **San Ysidro Ranch** transformed from zero entertainment to nightly jazz in early 2024 — a "dark to active" transition identical to the Lodge's opportunity, executed successfully at an ultra-luxury property.
8. **Zero SoCal fine dining restaurants** program regular dinner entertainment — A.R. Valentien with live Spanish guitar would be the only one.

### Competitive Positioning Language (Updated)

> "Every luxury resort within 100 miles of the Lodge programs live entertainment — most nightly, all at least 3 times a week. Montage Laguna Beach has run the same resident pianist for 22 years. San Ysidro Ranch — a 41-room property — hired three musicians a day. The Lodge is the only Five Diamond property in Southern California with zero. And no competitor programs music in their fine dining room. A signature Spanish guitar residency at A.R. Valentien wouldn't close a gap — it would create a category of one in the SoCal luxury market."

### Timing Intelligence

- **Terranea** typically announces summer Sound Series lineup in April–May
- **Ritz-Carlton** Candlelight concerts are booked months ahead (March 2026 dates already listed)
- **Rosewood** has already published 2025 expanded programming
- **Four Seasons Biltmore** reopening summer 2026 will need entertainment from day one — programming decisions are being made now
- **February–March remains the right window** for summer 2026 outreach. Not early. Possibly getting late for properties that plan further ahead.
