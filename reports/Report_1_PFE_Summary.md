# Report 1: PFE Executive Summary

**For:** Pacific Flow Entertainment outreach to Oscar Gonzalez, F&B Director, The Lodge at Torrey Pines
**Date:** February 23, 2026
**Based on:** 46-property landscape scan (8 research batches)

---

## 1. Landscape Snapshot

**88% of Five Diamond/Five Star properties surveyed program live entertainment.** Of 33 individual properties across Tiers 0-3, 29 actively program music. The only properties at zero are nature retreats (Post Ranch Inn, Blackberry Mountain) where silence is the product, one closed property (FS Biltmore), and the Lodge at Torrey Pines.

**Most common activation model:** Weekend lounge/bar programming with acoustic or jazz performers. 28% of active properties program nightly. Residency programs (named performers on recurring schedules) exist at the highest-performing properties — Montage Laguna Beach (Steve Siu, 22 years), The Breakers (DJ UKi, 10+ years), The Broadmoor (Director of Music tradition, 100+ years).

## 2. San Diego Competitive Gap

**Seven of eight San Diego competitors program entertainment. The Lodge is the only one at zero.**

| Competitor | Entertainment | Frequency |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Rancho Bernardo Inn | Pony Room + Veranda | **Nightly** + 3 extra nights |
| Estancia La Jolla | 2 venues (2 miles from Lodge) | **6-7 nights/week** |
| Park Hyatt Aviara | Lobby + terrace + Jazz series | **Nightly** + seasonal |
| Fairmont Grand Del Mar | 5+ activations including Supper Club ($165/pp) | Fri-Sat + events |
| Rancho Valencia | Lounge programming | Fri-Sat |
| L'Auberge Del Mar | Restaurant/patio | Weekends |
| Hotel del Coronado | Multiple venues | Weekends + seasonal |
| Pendry San Diego | DJ/nightlife | Thu-Sat |

Five of these competitors use the same vendor (Acoustic Spot Entertainment). PFE would differentiate the Lodge from properties sharing the same booking agency. Grand Del Mar has already published its summer 2026 entertainment calendar.

## 3. Oscar Gonzalez's Frame of Reference

**Every property Oscar has worked at programmed entertainment. The Lodge is the first zero in his career.**

- **Pelican Hill (pre-2016):** Fine dining Spanish guitar at Andrea — "live acoustic guitarist playing Italian and Spanish influenced light classical music." This is essentially what PFE proposes.
- **Fairmont San Francisco (2016-2023):** Tonga Room band on floating barge since 1945. Oscar experienced the COVID dark period and reopening — he's seen the restart cycle.
- **Hard Rock Hotel NYC (2023-2024):** Music IS the brand. His most recent role before the Lodge.
- **Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, SLS Las Vegas:** All programmed entertainment as standard practice.

Oscar's baseline for "normal" is a property with entertainment. He likely views the Lodge's dark status as an anomaly to be addressed, not a deliberate strategy. His experience at Pelican Hill's Andrea means he already knows what fine dining guitar looks and sounds like in a Five Star restaurant.

## 4. Activation Models PFE Could Propose

Based on the landscape scan, five models fit a Five Diamond resort with the Lodge's fire pit patio, fine dining room (A.R. Valentien), pool bar, and Craftsman lodge aesthetic:

### Model A: Fine Dining Guitar (A.R. Valentien)
Spanish/classical guitar during dinner service 2-4 nights/week. Validated at Pelican Hill Andrea, Ojai Valley Inn (Olivella), Eau Palm Beach (Breeze), FS Biltmore pre-closure. Oscar experienced this exact format at Pelican Hill. Fine dining music exists at only ~12% of properties — a differentiator, not a risk.

### Model B: Fire Pit Patio Sessions (The Grill / Outdoor)
Acoustic sets on the patio 3-5 evenings/week. Most common model in the study — lounge/patio programming is the lowest-risk, highest-atmosphere activation. Parallels: Estancia La Jolla (Trading Post patio daily), L'Auberge Del Mar (Kitchen 1540 patio), Rancho Bernardo Inn (Veranda).

### Model C: Signature Series (Monthly/Quarterly)
Branded event series tied to the Lodge's Craftsman identity — e.g., "Torrey Sessions" or "Lodge Live." Parallels: Grand Del Mar Supper Club ($165/pp monthly), Broadmoor Weekend of Jazz ($895-$2,715/pp), Auberge Concert Series ($175-$500 per event). Creates marketing content and premium ticketed experiences.

### Model D: Lobby/Lounge Ambient (The Lodge Lobby)
Background acoustic music in the lobby or adjacent lounge spaces. Lowest commitment, lowest cost. Parallels: Park Hyatt Aviara (nightly lobby guitar), Montage Laguna Beach (daily lobby piano), Sea Island (daily bagpiper). Can serve as the "always on" base layer.

### Model E: Layered Approach (Recommended)
Start with Models A + B (fine dining guitar + patio sessions), add Model D (lobby ambient) as volume grows, build toward Model C (signature series) for summer 2026. This mirrors the most successful properties (Grand Del Mar, Montage Deer Valley, The Broadmoor) which layer multiple activations across venues and frequencies.

## 5. Data Points for the Oscar Email

The 10 most compelling data points for a concise outreach email:

1. **7 of 8 San Diego competitors program live entertainment.** The Lodge is the only Five Diamond property in San Diego at zero. Estancia La Jolla (2 miles away) programs 6-7 nights/week.

2. **82% of guests say live music makes their experience "significantly more enjoyable"; guests stay 80% longer and spend 60% more on F&B** (BMI/NRG survey). 5-10% check average increase. ~25% revenue jump on live music nights.

3. **Pelican Hill's Andrea restaurant** — where Oscar worked — featured "live acoustic guitarist playing Italian and Spanish influenced light classical music." This is the format PFE proposes.

4. **Every property in Oscar's career programmed entertainment.** Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, Pelican Hill, Fairmont SF (Tonga Room since 1945), SLS Las Vegas, Hard Rock NYC. The Lodge is his first zero.

5. **Grand Del Mar has already published summer 2026 entertainment dates.** Competitors are 2-3 months ahead of the Lodge in programming decisions.

6. **No luxury brand mandates entertainment — it's always the F&B Director's call.** Oscar has full discretion. As an independent Evans Hotels property, there's no brand standard to consult.

7. **San Ysidro Ranch went from zero to nightly jazz in 2024** — a Forbes Five-Star SoCal property that added entertainment and runs it 7 nights/week. Proves the zero-to-active path works.

8. **Five SD competitors use the same vendor (Acoustic Spot Entertainment).** PFE offers differentiated, curated programming — not the same agency everyone else uses.

9. **Spanish/flamenco guitar is validated at 5+ luxury properties** in this study: Ojai Valley Inn, Eau Palm Beach, San Ysidro Ranch, Pelican Hill, FS Biltmore pre-closure. It's an established luxury resort genre.

10. **87% of guests would spend less at brands perceived as cutting costs** (UJET). Zero entertainment can signal cost-cutting to Five Diamond guests.

## 6. Competitive Positioning Language

The industry vocabulary from this landscape scan:

| PFE Should Say | Because |
|---------------|---------|
| **"Cultural programming"** | Used by Auberge (dedicated corporate role: "Brand Experience & Cultural Programming"), Joe Ogdie ("bring culture alive at the hotel") |
| **"Signature entertainment"** | Used to describe branded, recurring series (Grand Del Mar Supper Club, Broadmoor Weekend of Jazz) |
| **"Sense of place"** | Rosewood's core philosophy; Mike Kass (RC Waikiki): "authentic sense of place." Connects music to the Lodge's Craftsman/Torrey Pines identity. |
| **"Music residency"** or **"artist residency"** | Used for named performers: Steve Siu (Montage, 22 yrs), DJ UKi (Breakers, 10+ yrs), Jeremy Davenport (RC NOLA, 25 yrs) |
| **"Curated entertainment"** | Differentiates from generic booking agencies. Montage uses "Music at Montage"; Four Seasons uses Bellosound "music curation." |
| **"Experience partner"** | Positions PFE as strategic, not transactional. Parallels Auberge's Mercedes-Benz/Bilt presenting sponsors. |

**Avoid:** "Background music," "entertainment vendor," "booking agency" — these commoditize the offering.

**Recommended PFE positioning statement:** "Pacific Flow Entertainment is a cultural programming partner specializing in curated music experiences for luxury resort properties. We create signature entertainment that strengthens a property's sense of place — the way Spanish guitar at Pelican Hill's Andrea or Steve Siu's 22-year piano residency at Montage Laguna Beach become inseparable from the guest experience."

## 7. Timing Intelligence

**February-March 2026 is the optimal outreach window — "just in time" for summer.**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Budget cycle | Lodge's 2026 budget is set with zero entertainment. But entertainment has historically been an operational expense at F&B Director discretion, not a capital budget item. Oscar can act without waiting for next budget cycle. |
| Oscar's tenure | 6+ months in role (started Aug 2025). Settled enough to make decisions, still in "put my stamp on it" mode. |
| Competitor timing | Grand Del Mar already publishing summer 2026 dates. Other SD competitors have year-round programming. |
| Lead time needed | Entertainment vendors typically need 4-8 weeks for regular programming. Feb-March allows April-May launch for summer. |
| Seasonal context | Summer is the Lodge's peak season. A new F&B Director's first summer is when they want to make an impact. |
| Dark-to-restart pattern | Every dark period in this study that coincided with new leadership resulted in entertainment restart or upgrade. Oscar + dark period = the exact trigger pattern. |

**The window is: NOW.** Past the formal budget cycle (so it's a fresh operational decision, not a budget fight), before summer (4-5 months of lead time), and before competitors lock in their calendars. Waiting until the next budget cycle (Aug-Dec 2026) means missing the entire 2026 summer season and giving competitors another year of advantage.
